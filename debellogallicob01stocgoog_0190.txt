The account given by Pliny (xvi. 55 5, 6) of the size of the
trees—and Pliny, we must remember, had himself been in
Germany-is like what Stanley had to tell us cf the virgin
forests of Centrrd Africa The guarled and entangled roots of
these giants cf the forest would raise hills when covered with
earth, or, where the earth failed to follow them, would leave
arches through which squadrcns of horse might pass. The
oaks clung with a savage tenacity cf life to the ground, inso-
much that some which grew around the lakes, when undermined

Roman galleys, that suddenly found themselves engaged in
a naval battle with their branches. Pliny says that the forests

Of the great rivers of Germany only the Rhine and Danube
(vi. 25, 5 2)¹ are mentioned by Caesar. The Maas (Mosa) and
Schelde (Scaldis vi. 33, 5 3) are to him Gallie rivers, flowing as

the Rhine, and the Ems, Weser, and Elbe (Amissis, Visurgis,

is alone in mentioning the Saale (Σάλας), which became known
through the death near it of the elder Drusus in the midst of his
victorious campaign. Tacitus (G. 41, 5 a) speaks of the Elbe
