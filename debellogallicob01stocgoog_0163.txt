climate is more temperate than that oi Gaul, that is, neither so
hot nor so eolo Strabo (iv. 5,§ a, p. soo) adds that there is
more rain than suove, and speaks of the long continuance oi
mist, and how during the whole day the sun is sometimes visible
only for three or four hours about noon Somewhat the same
observation as to the absence of sunshine might be made by
avisitor from Italy novv3 but there must have been still more
cause ior it then, before the country had been cleared oi woods
and marshes. Tacitus (Agr. ra) speaks to the sante effect as
to the frequency oi mist and cloud, but adds that there is no
extreme cold. Ii the climate even oi South Britain was dark
and sunless in those days, hov much more must this have held
true oi Caledonial There, says Herodian (iii. 14), ‘the air
appears always marty: a fact which he attributes to the
exhalations from the marshes

The comparative mildness of the British climate is attributed
now to the Guli Stream as its cause. Of this the Ancients
knew nothing, but they held that the sea contained heat in itseli
like an animal body (Cic. N. D. ii. i 26). Minucius Felix
adduces as one os the proofs oi a Divine Providence the way
in which the deficiency of sunlight in Britain was compensated
hythe varmth of the sea that floved round it ¹.

The length of the summer days, and conversely the shortness Langen

os the nights‚ vas a salient feature oi Britain in the eyes oi the ἔξω

hncients ¹. It was a point that attracted especial interest, days.
because their men oi seleuce had already arrived on a priori
grounds at the conviction that this must be so, and that at the
North Pole there must be day and night lor six months con·
tinuously. It had been ascertained that at Meroe in Aethiopia
the longest day vas something over twelve equinoctial house, at
Alexandria fourteen, and in Italy fifteen. By Pliny’s time it had
been determined that the longest day in Britain was seventeen
