212 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

tinus was now among the upper centurions, and fairly advanced
among them. Once more he volunteered ior service against
the Aetoliam and King Antiochus, against whom war was
declared in nc. ror. This time he was promoted hythe
oonsnl Acrlius to the command ol the ‘ primus princeps prioris
centuriae! Aiter the expulsion of King Antiochus and the
subjugation ol the Aetolians the army was shipped back to
Italy, where he sewed lor two years. Alter this he ionght
twice ln Spain, once under Q. Fulvius Flaccus and again undu
Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the father oi the famous tribunes,
who was praetor in Spain in nc. 181. No sooner bad he been
brought home by Flaccus to share his triumph than he started
lor Spain again at the request oi Gracchus. Four times within
alew years he was leader os the ‘primus pilus'3 he received
rewards lor gallantry thirty-four times from his commendem
and was presented with six crowns ior saving the lile oi a
sellun-countryman. The last thing we lrnow oi him is that
he was appointed, when over fifty, to the command ol the
‘primus pilus' in the first legion which was to serve against
Perseus in ac. 17¹ (Lis. xlii. 34, 35).

This digression has not been irrelevant; t'or, though the
distinction between ‘hastath' ‘principes’ aud ‘triarii' or 'pieni’
was swept away when the army was remodelled hy Marius,
yet the centurions even in Caesar's time retained the titles
which had a meaning only under the old system. Thus P.
Sextius Baculus, the leading centurion of the twelfth legion, is
called by Caesar (iii. 5, ς a) ‘primi pili centurio,' and by a
convenient, hut illogical abbreviation, ‘primipilus’ (ii. agi r)¹.
