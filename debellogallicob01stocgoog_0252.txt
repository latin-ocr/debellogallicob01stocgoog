220 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

We come now ιο the rank and iile, the mere iood ior spears,
the patient instrument os Rome's imperial destiny, known as
the ‘manipularis' or ‘ gregarius milea'

In the French Museum oi National Antiquitiee at Saint-
Germain there is a statue oi a Roman legionary ereeuted by
the sculptor Barthoidi aiter the bas-reliefs on the oolumn oi
TraJan. It presente to us the Roman soldier in his habit ae
he lived. But as the period to which it belongs is a oentury
“ and a hali aiter the Gallio war, we cannot saiely use it for our
present purpose. The ‘bracoae' in which the ligure is clad, cut

short below tbe knees, aiter the faebion oi our modern athleta,
are alone sufficient to put us on our guard. The obvious
advantages oi breeches led to their introduction into the soldier's
gerb, in or before Trajan's time, but we may saiely assum that
they were not worn under the Republic, when abe army was
still Roman and not cosmopolitan. Even so late as the time
ol Vitellius (n. n. ⁶9), Caecim, one of his generals, gave a shock
to all ‘right-thinking' Romans¹ when he appeared amid the
townships and colonies oi Nortbern Italy arrayed in the plaid
and breeks oi Gaul.
