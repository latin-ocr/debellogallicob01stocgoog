Intimately connected with the grem sire os the Germans was

the lateness oi their physical development and the chastity of

their youth, on which Caesar (vi. ης 4) has commented ¹.
From the homogeneity ol appearance among the Germans

⁰ ¹² · Tacitus inserted a great purity of race. He was inclined to

think them indigenous ‘Their lays,' he says, ‘which are their
only history, celebrate a god Tuisco, who was sprung from
earth-and his son Man, as the origin and founders of their

Gauls were descended from Dis poter. The Teutonic Adam
appears under the name ‘Mennor’ in a late mediaeval poem ol
Meister Frauenlob‚ which is quoted by Grimm—

As Adam was taught Hebrew‚ so was Man taught Dutch.

and the Germnns, it may be noticed, do not call themselves
‘Germano' nor yet ‘Allemands,' but Dutch (Deutsch)‚ which
is supposed to mean merely ‘belonging to the people or nation.'
But just as the name Allemanm'was imposed upon the whole
body owing to the importance of a particular tribe at sparticular y
period, so it would seem to have been with the name Germani

(G. a, i 5), belonged to a tribe called ‘Germani' and the name
spread from them to the whole rece ³. In the historian's own
time these early settlers were known as Tungri. We may
identity them with the ‘Cisrhenane Germans' of Caesar
(ii. 3, ξ 4; 4, 5 ιο; vi. a, ξ 3), who comprised the Condmsi,
Eburones, Caeroesi, and Paemani. Their name survives to the
present day in Tongres.
