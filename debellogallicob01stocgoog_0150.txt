metrical geogrsphy, rrho is assigned to the lstter half os the
fourth century of our ern In his Ora Maritima, e poem in
iambic verse addressed to s youth nmned Probus, he claims to
have derived pert oi his inlormstion from the records oi the

voyage of Himilco the Csrthaghuien :-

‘ Hsec olim Himilco Poenus omno super
Spectesse semet et probasse rettulit:
Hsec noe, eb imis Punicorum ennelibus
Prolsts longo tempore, edidimus obt·
412-415, Wernsdorl'.

This Himilco ves d'upstched hythe Carthaginisns to explere
the cossts oi Europe st the same time that Hanno was sent
round Africa. We have no clue to the date ol these voyages
beyond the vague words of Pliny, who says that they took place
in the most flourishing times oi Carthage ¹. Pliny says nothing
ns to the dimsnce to which the voyage ol Himilco extended;
nor does Avienus essert that he reached the British lsles, but
only that he came to some islsnds called Oestrymnides, which
were rich intio and lesd. Two days' ssil from there, the poet
goes on to say, wne the Holy lsle, inhabited by the Hibernium,
end near thet again ves the island of the Albiones-

‘Propinqua rursus insule Albinnum petet'-112.

The Oestrymnides themselves ere declsred to have lain in
a bsy under s rochy promontory running south, and their
inhabitants are described as a vigorous end proud race, skilled
in mining, ond much devoted to trade, who navigeted vast
waters in bonts msde of skin, whereby we are reminded of the
corncles used by the Britons. In fsct il we were to amslgnmnte
the two sources ol the tin trude known in Caesare time-Spain

and Britain-ve should have something corresponding to the
description of Avienus.
According to Avienus there was a trade kept up with the
