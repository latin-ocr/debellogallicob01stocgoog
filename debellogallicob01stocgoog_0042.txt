10 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

a couple of years before his desth. Boolrs iii-vi of this
encyclopaedic treatim are devoted to a survey of the different
countries of the globo, bnt he does not profess to gire more than
a bare list of nemesi
i . For this dryness oi the elder Pliny we are compensated in
the next generation by the delightful works of Tacitus, whose
Germania and Agricola are too well known to justify their being
dwelt on here.
Ptolemy, whois said to have flonrisbed in thereignof Hadrian
(nn. 117-138h but to have surviwed Antoninus Pius, who died
in nn. 161, is intrinsically of the utmost importante, but he has
little or no interest for the student of Caesar. His work is more
scientiis in form than that of any of his predecessors, giving
the latitude and longitude of the places mentioned3 buthe
reduced geography to its lowest terms excluding all thot comes
under history or anthropology.
Appian of Alexandria wrote his great work on the wass of
the Romans about 900 years after the founding of the city, n. n. κ
146 (Praef. 9). His fourth book, which dealt with the wars of
the Romans with the Gauls, hes unfortunately perished We
possess only an abstract made by a careless epitomizer, together
with extracts from Suidas and other sources.
Ammianus The account oi Gaul given by so late a writer as Ammianus

it not for the fact that it is professedly based on Timagenes
(Amm. Marc. xv. 9, ξ a, Eyssenhardt), who is quoted also by
Strabo es an authority on Gaul. In one part of bis description
of Gaul and its inhabitants (xv. rr, ἕξ 1-4) Ammianus closely
follows Caesar.

summus auctorum. Of course we hnve to bear in mind that
the veneration shown for him is not due entirely to his merits
