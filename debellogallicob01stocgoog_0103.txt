of the passes into Gaul.

After this the attention of the Romans was diverted from The
Gaul hy the long and shameful wars in Spain, so that wezffirgion
have the unusual blank of eighteen years in our annale. But Romam
when the struggle between Roman and Celt recommencea after &mdia
this pause, we find the tide of aggression completely turned, and
