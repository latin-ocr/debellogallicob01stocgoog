the bodies of those who were unable to bear muns. At last, how·
ever, the longed-for relief arrived, consisting, if we may credit
Caesar's statement, of 8,ooo horse and about asoooo foot. 'lhis
vast host was commanded by Commius, king of the Atrebates,
once Caesar's most faithful servant, by Viridomarus and Epore-
dorix the Aeduans, and by Vercassivellaunus, a cousin of Vercinge-
torix. On they came in their pride, thinking to sweep everything
before them, especially as Caesar would be attached from the
other side by Vercingetorix. But the Romam stood firm, every
soldier knowing and lreeping his place, and, after a battle which
lasted from midday to sundown, the relieving force was defeated

sivellaunus, the other was in the countervallation, where it ran over
the heights, possibly on the slopes of Mont flavigny. Here
a desperate affort was made by the besieged to break through.
Caesar sent Labienus with six cohorte to the relief of the two
