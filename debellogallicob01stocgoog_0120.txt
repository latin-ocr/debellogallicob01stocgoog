Nune of The inhabitants ol this country were called Celti or Celtae,
{muts Galli or Galatae. The last is merely the Greek form assumed
by thesaure name which the Romans expressed by Galli ⁸. As
the Greeks called the Gauls Γαλάται, so they called their home
Γαλατία, whether it were in France, Italy, or Asia Minor. But
this name came into use at a conpanuvely late pen'od;
originally the Greeks called the people Κελταί and their country
ttehnni’. This latter is the name given to France in the
fragments os Hecataeus which have been preserved to us
by the geographer Stephanus oi Byzantium, who lived about
a thousand years later than the author he is quoting. We find
that Hecataeus was acquainted not only with Marseille, but also
withNarbonne,and withatown called Ndpafmtherwise unknown⁴.
Herodotus Hecataeus seeum to have possessed more definite information
ἓξὲξ about Gaul than his follower Herodotus, who jumbles up
together the Danube, the Celts, the Pyrenees, and the Pillars
ol Hercules⁸. Still some important laets seem to emerge from
the confusing statements ol Herodotus, namely, that the Danube
was in his day considered to come from the country oi the Celts,
and that these Κελταί were the people who dwelt lurthest to the
west ol any in Europe with the exception ol one, whom he calls
the Cynesii or Cynetes (Hdt. ii. 33; iv. 49).
