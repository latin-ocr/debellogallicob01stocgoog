Britain the tides rose to a height ol eighty nubite, which is
nearly 120 t'eet. If Pytheas said this, he must certainly have
drawn the long bow. The average height os the tides is seven
feet, though in creelrs aud inlcts it may be considerably greater.
In the Bay oi Fundy in Nova Scotia the tide 'u said to rise as
much as fitty feet

'lhe way in which the rivers of Britain are affected hythe 'tjtdal
tides is noticcd by Mela (iii. ξ 51), who puts the matter however mera
in a somewhat topsy-turvy way, saying that ‘atone time they
llow into the sea and at another time flow back?

After the conquests os Agricola had opened Caledonia to the Inter-
Romans, the intermingling of sea and land in those parts was ffsigiffid

In''' nn ra, 5 1 we have the startling assertion that the tides occur

expedients to remove this strange misstatement‚ but there stands
the passage in the MSS. It becomes more possible to imagine
that Caesar might have made such a mistalre, it we bear in mind
that he did not taire command in person os his fleet during its
omrations on the coast of Armorica, but entrusted it to Decimus
