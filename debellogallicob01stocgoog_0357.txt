already seen service against the Allobroges, into the Vallis Poenina
(le Valais) in command ol the tvellth legion and some oi tbe
cavalry. Galba had instructions to winter, il be deemed it expe·
client, among the tribes which dwelt here on the upper course ol
the thne before it flows into the Lake oi Geneva. After some
successful operatione Galba posted two cohorts in the territory of

the Nantuates, whom M. Desjardins places near villeneuve, and
