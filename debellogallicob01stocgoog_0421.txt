wood, about a mile from Wye on the north side ni the river.
From Wye he conjectures that Caesar went to Dorking and then
down the left bank ot' the Mole to the nearest point ot the Tharnes.
He is inclined to accede to the tradition that Caesar crossed the
Thames at the point known as Cowey or Coway Stakes, a little
above Walton and below Weybridge, though be thinks that the
hmous stakes themselves, which are referred to by the Venerable
Bede as having been planted by Cassivellaunus (Eccl. Hist. 1. a),
must have been the piles os an ancient bridge. No one need look
sor these stakes now, but the place where they once stood is ‘at the
distance of a furlong to the west of the northern end of Walton
Bridge’ Lastly, the town of Cassivellaunus be considers to be the
ancient Verulam or St. Albana.

The Emperor N apoleon 111, on the other band, who had
Mt. Lewin's reasoning before him, lands Caesar at Deal, repre-
sents the barbariaus as drawn up to oppoee him on the heigbts oi
Kingston beyond the Little Stour, makes Caesar march to the
Thames by Maidstone aad Westerham, and cross it perhaps at
Sunbury. He inchoes to accept St. Albana as the ‘oppidum’ oi
Cassivellaunus. This is the sole point in which the two writers
agree, and lor this there is no evidence. Aa regards time the
two authorities are much better agreed than as regards place.
Mr. levin calculates that Caesar sailed t'or Britain on July 183
the Emperor makes it the aoth. Both agree that he left Britain
finally on September 21, but Mr. Lewin anives atthis conclusion
by a calculation oi the tides, while the Emperor takes it t'rotn
Cicero (ad Att. iv. 17, § 3), who says that be had received letters
from his brother Quintus and from Caesar when they were in the
act of departing hom Britain, and that these letters were dated
the dth day before the Kalends οΙ October. Now this is the day
which in Le Vetrier’s tables corresponds to September 21.

Alter his return irotn Britain Caesar’s lirst care was to hold out
at Amiens (Samarobriva) the ‘council ot' the Gauls ' which he had
instituted sor his own purposes3 his next was to arrange the
winter-quartem of his anny. The harvest had been bad owing to
the dryness οΙ the season, so that he was obliged to scatter his
fornes over a wide area.

There are eight and a hali legions mentioned. The following
