that he had not then learnt it. The name Portus ltius may have

been given to the place hythe Romans themselves during their η
aecood scay there iu 54. There is a small village called laqueo 1

ou the left bault ol the Liane, which the sea is said to have reached
iu fomter times, and which some have thought may have given its

name to the har-bour. Gesoriacum is οἱ later date than Caenr, l
