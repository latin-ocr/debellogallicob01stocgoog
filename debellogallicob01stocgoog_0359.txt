Crassus, he sent orders for battleships to be built in the Loire aud

for due preparations to be made for a naval war. As soon as the ’

season of the year permitted‚ he came into Gaul himself. The
Veneti and their allies, some of whom had been fetched even from
Britain, were equally active ou their side, and their hopes of
success ran high.

F or feer lest the example of a patriotic confederacy should prove
contagious, Caesar scattered his forces over Gaul. Labienus was
sent into the country of the Treveri to overawe the Belgians and
prevent the Germans from crossing the Rhine; Publius Crassus
was despatched into Aquitania, lest aid might be sent from there;
Sabinus was given three legions wherewith to operate against the
Venelli (Cotentin), the Curiosolites (Cdtesdu·Nord), and the
Lexovii (Lisieux). Decimus Brutus was put in charge of the lieet,
which had orders to assemble in the country of the Veneti, whither
Caesar himself marched with the land forces The situation of
their towns, which were built on promontories to which there was
only access at low water, protected the Veneti from injury, and, if
ever they were threatened hythe Roman works, they had only to
ship off themselves and their wongings to some other place of
safety. Caesar found that his labour was being thrown away, and
determined that he must vait for his lieet. When it carne, it
seemed at first.very ill-matched against the larger and heavier
ships of the Veneti. But the Romans had cunningly prepared
hooks with which they cut the ropes which boum the yard·arms
to the masts of their adversaries, after which they could hoard
their ships at their will. They did this with the more energy
inasnnmh as Caesar and the land army were looking on from the
neighbouring heights. The barbarians began to think it time to
retice, but the very elements fought for Caesar, for a sudden calm
fell, which lest them at the mercy of the ovili-rosving Roman
galleys. The result was a crushing defeat followed hy an uncon·
ditional sut-render. The senate were all put to death and the
people sold into alavery.

The sceneos the naval engagement is put by Napoleon 111 under
the heights of St. Gildas, at the entry to the Bay of Quiberon in
Brittany. M. Desjardins maintains that this is an entire mistake
aud that the action took place at the mouth of the Loire.

While Caesar was engaged in comhating the Veneti, his lieu·
