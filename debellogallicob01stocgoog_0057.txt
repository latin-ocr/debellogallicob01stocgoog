CHARACTER OF CAESAR 25

κ had erpired3 but as pro-praetor in the same province he
reduoed the Lusitani and Gallaeci, advanced the Roman arms
up to the ocean, and merited a triumph which he was obliged
to resign, as it clashed with his petition for the consulship.

Such were Caesar s prolusione for the great struggle that lay
before him in Gaul. He had served under no great commander,
