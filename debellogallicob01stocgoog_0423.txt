DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. V 159

Sabinus, but as being forced into an attaclt on the camp as part oi
a concerted movement; he added thet a large body ol Germane
had crossed the Rhme, and would be on the spot in two days3 in
conclusion he promised a sale-conduct to the Romans, it they
would relieve bis country of winter-quartem by withdrnwing to
the camp ol Cicero or Labienus. The words ol Ambiorix were
reported to the lieutenants and a council ol war was ealled. Cotta
and most ot' the officere were in lavour ol staying where they were
and delying any number ol Germaus3 Sabinus was strongly in
favour ol withdrawing‚ and his opinion ultimately prevailed. At
daybreak next morning they set out irom the oemp with along
train oi bnggage‚ but they had not gone more than two miles before
they lell into an ambush ol the enemy. The Romans were obliged
to abendon their baggage and form into a circle, in which order
they managed to hold out until about two o’clock in the alternoon
Then their losses induced Sabinus to sue lor terms. Ambiorix
ordered him and the officere who accompanled him to lay down
their arms ; they did so and were treacherously murdered. Cotta
died fighting along with most ot' the men. The residue returned
into their camp, where they held out with difficulty till nightlall‚
and then slew themselves. A lew escaped lrom the field and lound
their way to the camp ol Labienus, which was more than fifty
miles distent

Elated with victory, Ambiorix rode on into the neighbouring
territory oi the Aduatuci, ordering the loot forces to lollow him,
and then into that ot' the Nervii. The three tribes with all their
vassals teu with lury upon the camp ol Cioero. But the energy ol
the delenoe was equal to that oi the attach. Quintus, though in
ill health, did not rest even at night, until he was forced by his
men to spnre himself. Then the chieis ol the Nervii who were
acquainted with the lieutennnt made the same representations and
offers to him that had been made to Sabinus, informing him in
addition ol the late ol that commender. But Cicero’s only reply
was that, il they wanted terms, they must lay down their arms.
Alter this the Gauls began to invest the semp in Roman lashion,
as well as they could without the necessary tools. On the sewenth
day ol the siege they managed to set fire to the soldiers' huts,
which were thatched with straw alter the manner ol the country,
and at the same time medea desperate assault upon the rampart.
