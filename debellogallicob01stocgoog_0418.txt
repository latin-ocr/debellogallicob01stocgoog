154 C. IULf! CAESARIS

almost ready to be launched. The Portus ltius was appointed as
the place of meeting‚ while Caesar himself went off with four
legions lightly equipped and 800 horse into the territory of the
Treveri, who were contumacious enough not to come to his
councils There were two claimants for power in that tribe,
Indutiomarus and his son-in·law Cingetorixc The latter at once
tendered his submission3 the former at first meditated resistente,
but, finding himself insufficiently supported by the nobles, made
a forced surrender‚ and was converted into a mortal enemy by
Caesar's preference for his rival.

On returning to Boulogne Caesar found all the ships assembled,
with the exception of sixty, which had been built on the Seine,
and which had been driven back by contrary winds. The Gallie
cavalry were there besides to the number of 4,ooo, and also the chiefs
from all the states, most of whom Caesar was determined to bring
with him as hostages to prevent a rising in Gaul. Among the rest
was Dumnorix, who was extremely unwilling to gu Twenty·five
days did Caesar wait while the wind was settled in the north-west.
At last it blew fair, but at the moment of embarkation Dumnorix
rode off with the Aeduan cavalry. Caesar stopped the proceedings
and sent a large force in pursnit of him with orders to kill him, if
he resisted. He did resist, and the orders were carried out. The
Aeduan cavalry returned to Caesar.

Leaving Labienus in charge on the Continent with three legions
and 2,000 horse, Caesar now embarlred tive legions and the other

‘half of the cavalry on board the deet, and set soil at sundown with
a gentle breeze from the south-west During the night the wind
dropped and the ships were carried from their course by the tide,
so that in the morning Britain was to be seen on the left. The
tide however now turned in Caesar's favour, and by dint of hard
rowing the ships were got to the old landing-place about mid-day.
The landing was this time unopposed.

Consigning the fleet to the mre of Quintus Atrius, who was
left with ten cohorte and 300 horse, Caesar set out by night and
marched twelve miles to the spot where, as he had been informed
by captives, the enemy were collected. Tbeir cavalry and war·
chariots attempted resistance from the high ground on the far
bank of a stream, but were dislodged by the Roman horse,and
toolr refuge in a woodland fortress formed of a barrieade of timber.
