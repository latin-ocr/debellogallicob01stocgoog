to burst into Italy (xl. 17). This fear however proved ground-
less. But in 179 n. c. a body of 3,ooo Transalpine Gauls passed

quite peaceably into Italy, and asked the consuls and Senate ior
lands and for permissiou to live under the empire of the Roman
people. These again were ordered to leave Italy, and the
consul was this time instructed to punish the leaders (xl. 53).

Α couple of years afterwards (n. c. 177) we find Gaul divided
into two praetorian provinces. In the next year it is under the
proconsular command of C. Claudius, who recovered Mutina
from the Ligurians. Early in 175 there was an outbreak of the
Gauls in conJ'unction with the Ligurians, but it was soon put
down. The matter, however, was thought of sufficient impor-

forty victims (Liv. xli. 8, 14, 19). It was followed, significantly

land among citizens and ailies of the Latin name, the former
receiving ten jugera apiece‚ the latter three (xlii. 4).

In nc. 171 Gaul as a consular province fell to the lot of

Rome to complain that their colony was not strongly enough
fortified, considering how it was exposed to the attacks of
Istrians and Illyrians, the Senate asked them if they were
willing to have the matter intrusted to the consul C. Cassius,
and received the astonishing reply that C. Cassius had just
set out through Illyricum for Macedonia (where the war with
Perseus was begun the same year). The Senate woted that
three commissionem should start that very day and forbid him
to wage war on any ›nation without a decree of the house
(xliii. ι). Not being able to command in Macedonia, Cassius
served there next year as tribune of the soldiers under Aulus
Hostilius. While he was away in this capacity the Senate heard
something more about his proceedings the year before in his
province. A Gallie chief, named Cincibilis, sent envoys, one
of whom was his bmther, to complaiu that Cassius had devas-
