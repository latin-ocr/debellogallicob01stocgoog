of the Romans, who regarded the dog as a kind of danim 3
rather then as a companion. There was also a bard to sing
the praises of the iring, of the Allobroges, and of the ambassador
himself, so that the world might not he uneware of his birth, bis
courage, and bis wealth¹. The object of the mission was to
ask pardon from the Romans for Teutomalius, lring of the
Salluvii, who had fied for refuge to the Allobroges, and whose 3

of the Aedui, who were even then the allies of the Romans
(Liv. Epit. lxi). Domitius defeated the Allobroges at a town l
' called Vindalium, a little above Avignon, near the confluence
of the Sorgues⁸ with the thne. The elephants were effective
in spreading consternation among the Gauls, who left many
