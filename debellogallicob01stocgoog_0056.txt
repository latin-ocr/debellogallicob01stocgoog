24 cAEsstR’s GALLIC WAR

A good many people persuade themselves that they are Men
of Destiny: it is the few who succeed who persuade others
In the evil fate which so shortly overtook his assassins by land
and sea, Plutarch perceived the working even aller death of
Caesar's mighty ‘daemon' (Suet J. C. 89; Plut. Caes. 69).

1t remains only to speak of Caesar as a general. Nothing is
more remarkable about the ‘lords of the world' than the way in
which every Roman of distinction was assumed to be capable of
commandIng an army in the field without any previous training.
They did not always justify thIs assumption, but as a rule they
did? Cicero was one ol the least warlilre of men, but even he
took the command against dre robber tribes in his province,
and acquitted himself with sufficient credit to be saluted by his
soldiers as Imperator, so that we have letters extant from Caesar
Imperator to Cicero Imperator. Caesar himself was over forty

(a. c. 80). Two years later he seems to have had a brush with
the pirates under P. Servilius Isauricus (afterwards consul with
Caesar in nc. 48, the year of the battle ol Pharsalia), but he
hurried back to Rome on hearing of the death of Sulla (n. c. 78).
In the following year he was himself captured by pirates off the
island ol Pharmacusa ς no sooner however had they released
him for a ransom of fifty talents, than he launched a lleet from
Miletus and captured them He had been on his way to attend
the lectures of Apollonius Molo at Rhodes when this incident
occurred3 and he was again called away from his studies by
the alarm of war with Mithridates He crossed over into Asia,
levied troops on his own authority, expelled a lieutenant of that
monarch from the province, and confirmed the waverIng saith
ol the cities (Suet J. C. 4). His quaestorship in further Spain
was spent wholly in civil pursuits, and he left it before his time
