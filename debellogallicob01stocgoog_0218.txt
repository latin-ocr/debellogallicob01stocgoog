seem, oi thirty-three men ench, including the offioers ¹. From
each oi these troops three men were selected as commanders
(hdpym); these in their turn selected three others to look aiter
the rear. These subordinate officers are called by Polybius
ripa-yet, but their proper Latin name was ‘optiones ².‘ The
officer first selected had the command oi the whole troop; the
second and third were iu a strict sense commandere oi ten
(δεκάδαρχοι), but all three were called decurions (δεκουρίιιε
‘deciirio'), and the whole ‘turma' was regarded as consisting
oi three ‘decuriae’ In the absence oi the first officer the second
took the command oi the troop The origin of this organisatiou
is traced back by Varro to the three primaeval tribes of Rome,
which puts it on alevel with that oi the primordia! legion.
Varro notices that iu his own time, which was also Caesar's
time, the ‘optiones' were no longer selected hythe decurione,
but appointed hythe tribunes, a change which he attributes to
the spread ol patronage and iavouritism.

The wealr point about the Roman cavalry was originally the
insufficiency oi their armour. They wore no hreastplates¹ hut
only hands round the waist, like those oi the common soldier.
While this light equipment enabled them to mount and dis-
mount with facility‚ it st the sometime rendered an encounter

’ extremely hazardous. Moreover their spears were so sleuder
that the heads sometimes broke off from the mere motion oi
the horses, aud, as they were destitute of a spilre at the other
end (σαυρωτήρ), aii use was gone from them when this happened.
Lastly‚ their shieldsoi cowhide were not strong enough sor the
press oi battle, and were liable to rot sroru damp. These deiecta
had been remedied before the time oi Polybius (wi. 25),through the
adoption by the Romans oi the iuli cavalry armorrr oi the Greeks.
