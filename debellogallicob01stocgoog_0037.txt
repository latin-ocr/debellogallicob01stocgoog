THE COMMENTARIES 5

and his birth is put at about 155 a. u., that is to say, just two
centuries after Caesar’s first landing iu Britain.

Plutarch's account of the Gallie War (Caesar rii-27), though Plutarch.
briefer than that of Dio Cassius, is perhaps more important
Plutarch speaks of himself (De E apud Delphos, 385 Blas being
a young man when Nero visited Greece, which was iu au. 66-7.
Aperson of his omnivorous reading can hardly be expected to
be accurate ς and he makes some exaggerated statements, which
might easily have been corrected bya glauce at Caesar's own
antings. In the main he is manifestly following Caesar
himmll, but there are some points in which he seems to be
drawing upon independent evidence. Thus he tells us emphati-

cally that it was not Caesar in person, but Labienus acting
under his orders, who achieved the first success in the
Helvetian War by cutting to pieces the Tigurini. We should
certainly never have gathered this from the Commentaries
(i. ray: but the statement is repeated in two fragments of
lippian (Lib. iv. De Reb. Gall. gand 15), aud we cannot

lightly set it aside.

Again, in the matter of the Usipetes aud Tencteri Plutarch,
after quoting the rather suspicions account given by Caesar in
his Commentaries ¹, of his negotiatione with those unfortunate
barbariam, goes on to tell us, on the authority of a lost writer,
that when the Senate was voting a supplicatiou (cp. B. G. iv.
38, l 5) in honour of Caesar's victories, Cato proposed that he
should be surrendered to the enemy iu atonemeut for the
violation of the truce. The writer quoted by Plutarch appears
in his text as uaricem. He has been identified with the
Tanusius Geminus, whose Historia is quoted by Suetonius
(J. C. 9) as one of the authorities for Caesare period. This
Tanusius it has been thought may be the same as the Tamusius,
ol whose Annales Seneca (Epist. xciii. ad liu.) expresses so
low an opinion as a‘tedious and worthless production.
