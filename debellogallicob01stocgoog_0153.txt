BRIYAIN 121

northward of Britain, and near the Fronen Sea' (Str. p. ⁶3
adinit.,· cp. Plin. N. H. iv. ξ 104). ln this region, as we are

ἢ insormed by Pliny (N. H. ii. ξ 187), Pytheas recorded that the

’ days and nights were six months long. Here, too, ourmariner
declared that ‘ the world came to an end in a substance that
was neither sea nor land nor air, but a compound os these,
bke a jelly-hsh, in which earth and sea and all things hung
suspended, and that this served as a kind os bond of the

ᾗ univeme, through which ome could neither welk nor saih’ This
remarkable statement is expressly made on hearsay by Pytheas.

, All that he depones to himself is having seen the jelly-tish
appearance ¹. Perhaps he had only seen a good sea-sog.

’ Notwithstanding his denunciation os Pytheas Strabo admits
the accuracy of his astronomical and mathematical views with
regard to the countries bordering on the fronen rone, arrd
quotes without dissent his observatione on the peucity ot
vegetable and animal life, as one advanced northward, the
tumentation of life on coarse cereale, berries, and ronta, the
manufacture ol mead from corn and honey, where these were
to be had, and the use of large barus in place of threshing

' floors, which were rendered useless owing to the rain and
the absence ol sunshine (iv. 5, 55, p. aon). Other eminent
writers in antiquity acoorded a far less grudging acceptante to
the statements of Pytheas Eratosthenes had some doubts as
to the extent os his travels, which 'might well be inspired by
the mention oi the Tanais, buthe accepted him as arr authority
on Britain and Spain; Hipparchus is repeatedly censured hy
Strabo sor his belief in him; Pliny nowhere questions his
reracity and names him as an authority for three olbis books.
ln more modern times his reputation has been warmly defended
byhis great countrymam Gassendi.

The only mention ol the British Isles mat occurs in an extant Polybius.
Greek author prior to the time of Caesar is in Polybius (iii 57).
