Caeser’s Ol his oratory Quintilian says that, il he had had leisure

⁰³³⁰T· to devote himself solely to the lorum, no other name would
have been mentioned against Cicero's but his. ‘There is
such a force about hiri: that author goes on to say, ‘such
penetration and such energy, that it is plain that he spolie with
the same spirit with which he waged war; while at the same
time it is all set oli with a marvellous elegance ol diction,
ol which he made a special study’ (x. ης 114). This high
encomium from the greatest of all professore ol rhetoric is
pronounced upon the speeches ol Caesar, which have not
come down to us. The Commentaries donot aim at eloquence,
unless it be eloquence, as in a sense it is, to state one's meaning
in the clearest and simplest marmor that human language
admits ol: but that other merit os ‘elegance' is apparent
enough even in a work so unpretcnding.

informs us that Caesar wes the lavourite author ol Marahal

Africanus, Polybius ol Marcus Brutus, and Philippo de Comines
ol Charles V. The lost-mentioned sovereign, however, found
time to bestow upon Caesar as vell, lor he left behind
him a copy of the Commentaries annotated with his own
hand. Indeed Caesar has always had a peculiar fascination
