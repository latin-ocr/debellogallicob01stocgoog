to Mont Beuvray in 376 nn. We had just sat down to enjoy our
long-deierred bread and cheese‚ when a kind-looking old gentle·
man, with a long nose and a white heard, advanced to greet us.
ln a iew momente we were made welcotne to all the hospitality
his rooi could offer. Τ11ε cottage may be described in Pliny’s
phrase as a ‘verum secrdumque μουσεῖον] Α roorn plain even to
bareness, containing a single bed; on a sheli a lew books; the
walls decorated with paintings some oi considerable artistic merit,
others less s03 to tlte right oi the fite-place there were such
amiable inscriptions as the following :-

Fris bien d tout
N‘attends pas des reoonmissmees.
Aine tortt le monde

‘lhe stands which were set under the bottles on the table were
oi Gallie mmufucture and dug up at Bibracte 11 we had wanted
an egg, there was an egg-cup ready oi the same worlrmanship.
One oi the designo on the wall portrayed our host in the costume
oi a Gallie swineherd driving a pig to market. Another repre·
sented him as pointing a revolvet at a wolf ; forthere was still
an occasional woll about the country at the time when he began his
researchee Another, and very vell executed, design represented
a Gallie warrior and his horse There was also a representation
oi a moonlight effect done by sornebody who had arrived late at
the cottage.

After luncheon our host showed¹ us the campos Antony (viii. a),
of whichthe ‘vallum' is very well marked. He also pointed
out the place where a great Gallie iair used to be held and
where sbops had been discovered; also where the slanghter·
house stood. Tbese things had to be taken on trust, as well as
the statement that a certain rock, to which he brought us, was
the tribunal irorn which the Gallie princes used to deliver their
barnngnes, while the chiefs stood by on the oval platiorrn which
surrounded it. But'there could be no doubt about the steep

mount, extending, we were told, ior five lrilornetres and repre-
senting the walls nithe ancient town oi Bibracte.
