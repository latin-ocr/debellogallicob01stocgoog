THE confirmares 3

translations ol the Commentaries, which have either been
printed or published. Christina, Qneen of Sweden, composed
Rplexions on tlu [ψ and Actrhnr ‘ff Caesar, which she does
not seem to hate given to the world Louis Philippe had
amap made to illustrate Caesar's Campaigns in Gaul. Lastly
the two Napoleons made the Commentaries the object ol
their special cere. Napoleon 1, at St. Helena, dictated
a ‘Prscis des Guerres de Ceser’ to Comte Marchand, and
his nephew, Napoleon III, applied all the resources ol his
