92 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

the subject, but aster it or at the end oi the sentence. The 1
great quarry sor the student is the proper names of persons ,

and places, whether preserved in ancient authors or in inscrip-

tions ; even the brands on pottery are hunted up with eagemess
that something may be gleaned from them. But as Rome

imposed her laws and institutions upon the barbariam, so also J

did she mould their names into conformity with her owntongue.
The result in the case oi the Gauls is to give usa stateliness
oi nomenclatore surpassing that ol the Romans themselves.
Vercingetorix, Vercassivellaunus, Andecumborius‚ and other
