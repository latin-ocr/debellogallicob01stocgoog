172 cAESAR’s GALLIC WAR

The small siae of the German horsea has been already alluded
to. They were ugly and possessed of no great speed, but
they made up for these deficiencies by their powers ofendurance ¹.
They were ridden barebaclted, the German regarding a saddle
asa sign of effeminacy (iv. a, ᾗ 4). They were rather means
of locomotion than aids in actual fighting. For, when serious
work had to be done, the rider would dismount and stab his
opponent'a horse under him, tmsting to find his own trained
animal waiting for him on his return (iv. 2, ἅμ raia). ltwas
thus that the cavalry of the Usipetes and Tencteri, though them·
selves not more than 800, put to flight gono of Caesar's horse.

Tacitus pronounces that on the whole the strength of the
Germana lay in their infantry rather than in theh cavalry, and
gives this aa the reason why they combined the two in the
‘hundreda' (G. 6,§ 5). Caesar (i. 48, §§ 5-7) has described
with admiration this mixed force as used by Ariovistus. ln the
army of that chief there were 6,000 cavalry, supported by the
same number of infantry, the swiftest and strongest that could
be found, each ‘man picked by man‚’ and chosen by the
horsemen with the care which was likely to be displayed in
a matter where their own safety was at stake. The font-soldiers
were such practised runners that, aided by the manes of the
horsea, they could keep up with their pace.

Although this mixture of cavalry and infantryis dwelt upon
by Caesar and Tacitus in special connexion with the Germana,
yet the practice was not confined to them. Vercingetorix had
light-armed infantry tningled with his cavalry (vii. 18, ξ ι); the
‘Trimarcisia' described by Pausanias among the Gauls that
invaded Greece was instituted on asimilar principle (see p. 59);
and at a period less remote from Caesar’s time (nc. 168)
a body of Gauls under Clondicus, consisting of 10‚0oo cavalry
and the same number of infantry, who could equal the speed of
the horses and were ready to take the place of the riders if they

on the horsea of the Sigynnae.
