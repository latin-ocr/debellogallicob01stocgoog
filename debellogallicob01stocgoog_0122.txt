90 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

the people who lived above Marseille, from the Alps to the
Pyrenees, were Κελτοί, while all the tribes to the north and away

to Scythia were ratim
gur We now come to the origin of this famous people. Other
· authors, Ammianus tells us, had left this subject incomplete, but

Timagenes had thresbed it out diligently, and he himself will
give us the results divested of all obscurity. The outcome of
bis labours, however, is not such as to enlighten us. There are
the usual eponymous heroes and heroines, and the usual attempts
to affiliate the foreign people to Greek mythology ¹. Hercules
was by some considered to be their progenitor (cp. D. S. v. 24);
by others they were traced to the Greeks who had wandered
from Troy. Some said that they were indigenous to the soil;
others that some were and some were not, but had come from
beyond the Danube. There is a wealth of theon'es to choose
between, but they only embarrass our choice. Nor if we turn
to modern writers shall we find anything but surmise on this
subject. The fact is that the Gauls have been in France as far
back as history goes. They are as autochthonous as were the
Atheniens, whom in other respectu they resemble. We know
something of Gallie emigration out of France, and nothing of
Gallie immigration into it. Let us be content then to own our
ignorance on this subject, and not claim a knowledge which the
Gauls themselves did not possess. Sons of night they claimed
to be (vi. 18, ξ ι), and sons of night we will leave them, without
an attempt to dissipate the darkness that enshrouds their origin.

So far we bave been speaking of the inhabitants of Gaul as
though they were a homogeneous people: but this assumption
requires to be corrected or modified. Since Gaul lies midway
between Spain and Germany, it might he expected that its
inhabitants would be found mixed with Iberians on theone side

and with Germans on the other. The case is so at the present
day, and it was so already in Caesar's time. Hence his three
