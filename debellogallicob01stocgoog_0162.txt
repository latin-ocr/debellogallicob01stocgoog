ascribe a blunder ol this kind to Caesar's copyists than to l
Caesar himself. He had learnt something about the tides by ¹
the time he sat down to write his work. A matter oi practical ¹
concern ol this kind is the very last on which he is likely to l
have continued in error. p
Pncticss Caesar's statements have a ring oi actual experience about t
{sspc‘ffi them very different from those ol the merely literary man who
has drawn his experience from books 1s he dwells on the y
boisterous waves and violent vinds of the ocean (iii. 8, § ις 14,
§§6‚ 7, 9), it is because he had found how ill his Mediterranean·
built galleys were fitted to eope with them, though that sea itseli
can raise very respectable waves when it is in the mood to do
so. Some indeed who have crossed from Dover to Calais might j
leel inclined to dispute his observation that the waves in the
strait rise less high than elsewhere; nevertheless it must be
admitted that there is truth at the bottom os it, even ifwe
question his explanation oi the fact as being due to the frequent
changes in the tide (v. 1, ξ a). Very different from such state-
ments is the hearsay remark os Tacitus as to the sluggishness of 2
the waters round the north coast oi Britain, ‘which yield with
difficulty to the oar and are hardly raised by the winds' (Agr. v
ιο). 1f Agricola's sailors could get round Cape Wrath‚ and χ
then give anything like this as the result oi their experience‚
they must have been singularly fortunate in their weather.
From the external features os our island let us now advance
to the internal, oi which the most important is climate. ³
climateof The first idea, which is represented by Diodorus Siculus
mn· (v. ar, 5 6), was that the climate oi Britain must be very cold, ἴ
as the country lay so sar to the north. Experience, however, ,

corrected this impression. Caesar (v. ra, ξ 6) remarks that the

eumd redux inthe atr-alta of Messius, says, asquoted by Strabo (i. p. 54), i
ute ‘rc γὰρ μεταβάλλειν rdr ῥοῦν ἑκάστης ἡμέρας mi meede, καθάπερ τὸν ¹
memor, tte ptr πλημμυρεῖν, δὶς dl ἀναχωρεῖν. Now we know that Caesar

used Eratosthenes. See vi. 24, ς a. Pliny (ii. l ala) puts the matter in

away that admits ol no mistake, ‘Bis iuter duos exortum lunae adfluunt

bisque remeant vicenis quaternisque semper nous·
