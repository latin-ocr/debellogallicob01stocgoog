168 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

remarking that the only difference in dress between the men
and women among the Germana was that the latter more often
wore linen garments According to Tacitus the usual dress of
the men was the sagum, fastened with a brooch or, falling that,
a thorn¹. He distinctly asserts that they wore nothing more,
at least indoors in their own inglenooks. It was only the very
rich who were distinguished by what a Roman would regard as
clothing¹, and this, adds the historiari, was not loose, like that

savage dandyin in varying their mantles oi hide by sewing on
patches of what we may suppose to be sealskin.
