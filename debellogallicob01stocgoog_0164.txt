houm ¹. Very wild ideas however were abroad on this subject, as
the one referred to by Caesar (v. 13, § 3), that in Mona there was
night for thirty days continuously at midwinter, an error which
was riie in a still more exaggerated form in the time os Pliny ².
Caesam treatment os this question is conceived in a spirit of
scientific cantion He could lind out nothing about the matter
by inquiry, but he toolr definite measurements with the water-
cloclr, which convinced him that the nights in Britain were
shorter than those on the Continent. Tacitus (Agr. ra) says
that the days in Britain were longer than those ol the Roman
world, that the night there was bright‚ and in the lurthest part
short, so that there was only a slight interval between sunset
and sunrise. ‘They assert,’ he adds, ‘that it clouds do not
intersere, the brightness ol the sun is beheld during the
night, and that it does not set and rise, but pasees across the
horizon!

The general character ol the country is correctly described
by Strabo (iv. 5, i a, p. 199), il we take his words to apply to
South Britain. He says it is mostly plain and well wooded, but
that there are also many hills covered with soil‘. Mela speaks
to much the same effect, saying that the country is large and
level and fertile, though richer in grass than in com. He also
mentions the woods and lorests and the great sizc ol the rivers,
ol which his inlonnants probably judged lrom their mouths.
From that point ol view the Thames, Sevem, and Clyde are
more impressive than the Rhine or Danube.

hut the calculation is made ior the latitude ot' Greeuwich. For Pliny’s
statements on this subject see N. H. ii. t 186; vi. ς rao ’

'He says (N. H. itt 187) that some people essert thnt in Mona the
day and night are of six months' duratiou. Mona, he adds, is distant
about aco miles irom Camulodunum (Colchester). In Pomona Pliny’s
mark about the ‘ catate lucidae noctcs’ oi Britain becomes quite apposite
'l'rtere one cen takes midnight wallr in summer by a very sair light which
ir not that oi the moon.
