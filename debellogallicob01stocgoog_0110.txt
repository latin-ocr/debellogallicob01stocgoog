Marius brolre up his camp and followed them cautiously. Over-
taking them at Aquae Sextiae, where they were enjoying the
hot baths which nature provided, he inflicted a defeat upon
the Ambrones. These, according to Plutarch, were 30,000
strong in themselves, and had been the victors over Manlius
and Caepio. Shortly afterwards, hythe aid of strategy, he
annihilated the host with fearful carnage. The rains of winter
which followed with unusual severity washed their decaying
carcases into the ground, and the harvests which followed were
unusually abundant (Plut. Mar. ra-21; Liv. Epit. 68 ; V. P. ii.
1a,§4). The name Pourrieres, if it stands, as is supposed, ¹
for ‘Putridi Campi,' commemorares the event to this day.

Cimbri however did not press their advantage, but enjoyed
themselves in Venetia instead, indulging in the luxury of living
in houses, eating rich dishes instead of raw meat, and above
all swilling themselves with wine (flor. i, 38, ᾗ 13 ; D. C. fragm.
92). This gave Marius time to come from Rome himself,
whither he had been summoned after his victory, and to summon
his army from Gaul. The Cimbri sent ambassadors to him
asking for land and cities for themselves and their brethren.
Marius inquired who were their brethren When they replied
‘the Teutons,’ the other Romans present laughed, while Marius

grimly answered that as much land as they wanted had been
given them in perpetual possession To enforce the meaning
of his words he showed them some chieftains, who had been
captured hythe Sequani in the Alps. Among the prisoners

was Teutobodus himself, the lring of the Teutoni, who after-
wards adorned Marius' triumph (Plut. Mar. 24 ; Flor. i, 38,§ ιο ;
