bare thought ol it habitually as a laud oi snows and ice, much
as we think of Russia¹. For this three reasons may be assigned
-oneis the ingrained tendency to exaggeration which was
locered by the praefice oi rhetoric; another, that the Alps
were the threshold oi Gaul to the italiana, and affected their
ideas ol the whole country ; the third is the fact that the
clinate must really have been more rigorous then than now,
owing to the extent to which the country was covered with
troods and marshes. But more sedate writers, like Strabo
and Pliny, admit that the cumae ol Provence did not differ
from that of Italy. Sheltered between the Cevennes aud the
Alps, the basin oi the thue, which was, roughly speaking,
the Roman Provincia, bore, or was capable of bearing, all the
lruits ol Italy-‘ in fact,' says Pliny, ⁴ it is Italy rather than a pro·

comed it with avidity, but whose rulers were suspicions ol its
mtrusion (ii. 15, 5 4 ; iv. a, 5 6: cp. Cic Font. 5 ao; D. S. v. 2⁶,

trees. No part ol it was unproductive, save what was covered
with marshes (Str. iv. r, 5 a ; Mela iii. 5 17). It abounded with
cattle oi various kinds, and enjoyeda marked absence oi norious
anmals. A little later han Caesar's time the district about the
Scine supplied Rome with its best bacon (Str. iv. 3, 5 a, p. 192).
