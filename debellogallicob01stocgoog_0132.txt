100 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

From this general sketch ol the character ol the Gauls we
must now advance to some more specilic mention ol the manners
aud institutions in which that character revealed itsell. These
relate to war and peace. To the student ol the Gallie War the
former naturally come first

governor The spacious plains of Gaul made it a country naturally

‘⁶²¹¹‘ adapted lor cavalry. Accordingly we lind that the fightrng
strength ol the Gauls lay chiefly in that department& Their
nobility indeed are called by Caesar ‘equites' and they were
anadon ol knights and squires. Cacsar tells us oi the love that
the Gauls had ior horses (tv. a, 5 a). We might judge ol their
success in this direction from the many Latin words connected
with riding aud driving which are oi Celtic origin (iv. a, 5 2 n):
perhaps Epona herself was a Gallie goddess, The Semne,
avare oi the fondness oi the Gauls ior horscflesh when they
wished to conciliate their chiese, sent them presents which
gratified this tastc. The Gallie envoys who accompanied
Cincibilis in 170 ac. (see p. 68) regarded it as a high privilege
to be allowed each to purchase ten horses and transport them
from Italy to Francc. Diodorus (v. 29, 5 ι) describes the· war-
chatiots in use among the Gauls, which Lucan also (i. 426)
attributes to the Belgae, but we hear nothing about them from
Caesar except in connexion with the Britons (iv. 33, 5 r).

The weapons oi the Gauls are described as very big—great
claymores and lances'. Their swords‚ says Diodorus (D. S. v.
30, 5 4), are as large as other people’s speum, and their spear-
points as other people's swords. The claymore was attached
to their lest sides by chains ol brass or iron (D. S. v. 30, 5 53

Str. iv. 4, 5 3).
