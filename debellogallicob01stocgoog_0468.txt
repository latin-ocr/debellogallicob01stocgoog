204 c. rvrrr caesareis

The indicatione oi locality in connexion with these movemts
are so faint as to defy conjecture lt may be mentioned however
that Napcleon 111 assumet the river mentioned in 7,§ 5 to have
been the Ourthe, a tributary of the Mense.

Having barren the retreat of Ambiorix to the north, it was now

Caesar's object tc cut off hio escape to the east. At thesametime ,
the nid sent by the Germana to the Treveri seemed to call for ,
a counter demonstration. Accordingly he again constmrreda Ἴ
bridge over the Rhine‚ at apointalittle higher upthanthe former l

one, and crossed once more into German territory. The Ubii at
once sent an embassy to clear themselves ircm all suspicion of
antagonism to the Romans. lt wne the Suebi, they naid, who had

sent uid to the Treveri. But the Suebi had retircdtothe confines ³

of a vast forest which separated them from the Cherusci, und
thither Caesar had no mind to follow thenr. lt har been remnrred
with what art the account of Gaul and Germany (che. 11-28) has
been introduced at thiu point to cover the complete absence oi
incident during Caeear's second etny across the Rhine. Part of it

is n repetition cf what had been said in the beginning cf Book IV Ἴ

about the Suebi. How long this second stay laetcd Caesar has
not thought fit to tell uu. On returning to Gaul he destroyed only
that part of the bridge which touched the hanlrs of the Ubii,
leaving twelve cohorte to guard the remainder as a standing

, menace of the possibility cf hir return.

All Caesar's energies were now devoted tc the direct pursnit cf
Ambiorix. Tuming baclr from the Rbine through tlre forest cf
Arduenna (Ardennes), which then reached its benks, he sent his

cavalry in advance under 1. Minucius Basilus, whom he instructed r

to allow no fires in the camp lest they should attract the notice of
the enemy. So much despatch and souccy were employed that
Ambiorix was talren unawaree. His arms and accoutrements and
his conch und horres were seized, bnt he himself eecaped, thanks ,
to the fidelity cf his retainers‚ who held back the icc long enough
to enable their lord to mount his horse and ride away into the
wocds. Ambiorix made no attempt at reeistnnce, but proelaimcd

a swve qui perat. His people fied in varicus directions, and his
fellcw·chief Catuvolcue took refuge in the grave.

Two oi the Cisrhenane German tribes, the Segni and Condrusi.
now sent to say that they had not taken part with their country·
