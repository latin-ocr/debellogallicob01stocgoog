between three orders iu this cluss. Strabo calls these three

orders Bardi, Vates, and Dryadee. T hose who with Strabo ere

Vates (οὐάτιις) are by Diodorus Siculus called nimae, and by
Ammianus Marcellinus ‘euhagis’ which is supposed to represent
the Gellic neme (Str. iv. 4, ξ 4; D. S. v. 31, §5 2, 3 ; A. M. xv.
9, i 8). The difference ol function between these three orders
isrepresented thus The bards were minstrels and poets, who
chanted the deeds oi heroes on the lyre and devoted their friends

and enemies to eulogy or execration. The Vates were diviners, κ

who were believed to penetrate into the future by means oi
augury and the inspection ol victims, and to explere the secrets
os nature. The Druids proper were the highest oi the three
orders. They were philosophers who to the ‘physiology' or

natural science oi the Vates superadded the study oi ethics. 3

One would like to have been present at those meetings in Rome
in which the Druid Divitiacus expounded his notions oi philo·
sophy to Marcus Tullius and his brother Quintus (Cic Dis. i.

ξ 90) : but, as it is, we must be content to know merely that the κ

Druids taught the doctrines ol the immortality oi the soul and oi

the universe, but thought that the latter was liable to be eon·

vulsed by lire and water (vi. 14, ξ 6 ; Mela iii. ᾗ 19). ,

There is no doubt but that the religion oi the Gauls contained ¹
in it higher clemente than that ol the Greeks end Romans,
in spite oi the bloody and barbarous rites by which it wss
defiled. The classical nations went to the priest lor their ritunl
aud to the philosopher or legislator lor their morality, but in the

Gallie religion these two lactors were combined. To the ‘

layman among the Gauls, whether gentle or simple, religion
presented itseli as the gulde oi lile, clothed in the awiul sanctities
ol the unseeu world, and inlorrned by s knowledge to which he

himself did not aspire. Hence the strong hold that it exer· ἵ

cised over the minds oi the messes. The Druids were a real
spiritual power, like the Catholic Church ol the Middle Ages

They could intervene on the battlefield and stop the rege ol ?

hosts breuhing seuguer (n. s, v. 31, y 5; se. tv. 4, ς 4).
