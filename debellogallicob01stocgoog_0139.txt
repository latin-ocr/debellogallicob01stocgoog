blood (v. 25, bg), while the latter barely escaped the same fate
(ν. 54, b a). We lind Caesar too rewnrding the fidelity ol
Commius by making him king over his own countrymen the
Atrebates (iv. ar, ς 7), and subjecting the Morini also to his
sway(vu76,§1). lfwe knew a little more about the matter,
we might be able to distinguish more clearly between the
legitimare and bereditary king and the ambitious man who
climbed to a precarious sowereignty through the favour ol tbe
people. That there were plenty os men in Gaul at that time
ready to play the despot's part is plain from sach cases as those
ol Orgetorix, Dumnorix, and Celtillus, the father of Vercingetorix.
Vercingetorix himself was proclaimcd king (vii. 4, ᾗ 5) as the
result ot a wide-spread popular movement, and agallant, though
belated, effort ol patriotism.

lt was the misfortune os the Gauls that they were so torn by Factlons
hction as to render an effective combination impossible. What
Tacinrs said ot their brethren ian’tain-‘dum singuli pugnant,
universi vincuntur' (Agr. ra)—was true also ol thern, and the
same history repeated itselt in the conquest os lreland by
¹ England. The very first remark that Cacsar has to malre in his
description of the Gauls (vi rr) has reference to the lactions
that divided states, hamlets, anderen single honses. Caesar
did not know what these factione were about, and probably the
Gvrls themselves would have had difficulty in insonuing him.

From the politica] we now turn to the social organisation of classes.
Gaul, which is curiously suggestive of the Middle Ages, with its
three classes os priests, knights, and nobodies.. The little that
Caesar has to say abont the two latter may be seen in vi. 13,
§l r, r and vi. 15. lt is the former that must occupy our
attention, ns they do his: for in treating ol them we shall be
dealing also with the religion ol Gaul, with some notice of
which this chapter may fitly terminate.

Thougb Caesar speaks of the priestly and learned class under Dmids.
the single name ol Druids, yet we find from the consentient
testimony ol other authors that a distinction basto be drawn
