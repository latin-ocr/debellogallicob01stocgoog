54 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR Ι

one Roman army in Etruria and another at Ariminum, and
respect sor these kept the Gauls from any overt acts ol hostility,
though they allowed secret levies to be held and ass'mted the
Carthaginians with supplies (Liv. xxviii 46, §l rvr, 123 xxix. 3,
§r5; 5, §5 5-93 App. vi. 37). During the time when Mago
was making his levies the proconsul M. Livius and the praetor
Sp. Lucretius joined their forces ln Cisalpine Gaul In the
next year (ac. 204) the same two generals were continued in
their command against Mago (Lis. xxix. 13, § 4), but it was not
until the following year, when M. Cornelius, the outgoing consul,
and P. Quinctilius Varus, the praetor oi Ariminum, were in
command in Gaul (Liv. xxx. 1, §§ 7, 9), that a pitched battle
was fought against Mago. The fight was long and obstinatcly
contested, and victory might have turned against the Romans,
had not Mago been wounded iu the thigh and esrded out ol
the field. Thia battle took plane iu the country ol the Insubres.
Alter it the CarthagInians retreated, as last as their general's
wound would allow thern, into the territory of the Ingauni

Ligures. Here Mago was met by ambassadors ordering his

immediate return to Carthage, and announcing that Hannibal
had been recalled too (Lis. xxx. 19, §l a, 3). Mago put to sea
at once with hIs army, hoping that a sea voyage might facilitate
his recovery, but he had scarcely got past Sardinia when he
died oi hIs wound.

a consul Α pathetIc incident is recorded as havIng taken place iu the

fflfstffl same year (nc. ²03)· The consul C. Servilius rescued his

slavery. lather, ol whose late he had been Ignoratu, from slavery among
the Boii, by whom he had been captured sixteen years before at
Tannetum (see p. 48).
