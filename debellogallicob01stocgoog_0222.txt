in Caesar's particularly on its constitution in the time of Caesar. We shall
‘¹³¹²‘ be obliged, however, often to refer back to an earlier state

ol things in elucidation of a later one.

ffidtvi What we may call the table oi the Roman army appears
in its familiar form as tar back as Cincius Alimentus. ln the
sixth hook oi his De Re Militari (Aul. Geli. xvi. 4, ᾖ 6) it
is given by that author in a form which we may put as
follows:—

acenturies make 1 maniple.
· 3' maniplos „ rcohort.
ro cohorte ‚, rlegion.

To the above table there might he added another denomina-
tion‚ namely, that two legions with their contingente oi allies make
one consular army. Such at least was the practice in old
times, when it was usual to enroll iour legions, two ior each

that a Roman army matched against the snarming multitudes oi
the Gauls, against the big limbs oi the Germans, against the
wiliness oi the Africans, against the intellect oi the Greeks
(Veget. i. ι). The courage of experience is more effective on
the field oi battle than that of native spirit. When a manis
confident that he has learnt to do a thing vell, including the
murder ol his brother, he takes a pride in putting it into
practice.

‘Legio' is derived by Varro from ‘legere‚’ in which case
