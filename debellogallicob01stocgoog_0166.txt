tant part in the pharmacopoeia of the Ancients, being regarded'
as a specific against the quinsy and against snake-bites, provided
it was guthered before thunder was heard, might seem from its
name to have reached the Romans from our island: but this
appears not to have been the case, although it grew there among
' other places (Plin. N. H. xxv. ξ so; xxvii.§ a).

The supposed mineral wealth of Britain attracted the cupidity
of the Romans. Tacitus, like Strabo, talks of its possesrn'ng
gold, silver, and other metuis, which made it worth while to
conquerit. Caesar himself (v. rs, ξ 4) appears to mention
gold coins as being in nse inB1itain. The reading, itis true,
isvery doubtful, but it is supported by the views of numismatists,
who hold that gold coins were struck in Britain about a century
before Caesar's landing. However that may be, Caesar himself
got no gold out of the country. For we find CicerO, who was
in correspondence with his brother Quintus, and with Caesar
himself, when they were in Britain, writing to Trebatius then in
Gaul, ‘I hear that there is uo gold or silver in Britain' (Ad

Fam.vii.7,§1). He expresses himself to the same effect to
Atticus (iv. 16,§ 13) with regard to silver, ‘This also is now
ascertained, that there is not s scruple of silver in that island,
nor any hope of booty, except from slaves, among whom
1 don’t suppose you expect any trained in the belles-lettres!

Expressions like these, however, cannot be pressed as evidence
for the absence of the precious metals, especially as Cicero
himself (Ad Att iv. 17, § 3) speaks of a money tribute as
having been imposed upon Britain by Caesar on his departure ¹.

Of iron Caesar (v. rs, § 5) says that it was found on the sea·
coast, but only in small quantities. This doubtless means that
only the natives of the south coast had the skill to extract it

¹ Caesar himself (v. ss, 5 4) uses the word ‘vectigaL' which might he
taken to indicate that the tribute was to be paid in kind Diodorus Siculus
(v. 21, ἱ a) however says-nal robe Πρεττανοὺς καταπολεμήσας ἠνάγκασε
