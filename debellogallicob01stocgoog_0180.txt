morals laclr satisfactory evidence, but he is not inclined to give

character to which Diodorus (v. 32, ξ 3) alludes.

Mela (iii. ς 53), like Juvenal, calls Irelaud Juvema. He
describes it as lyiug above Britain, being about equal to it
in size, and oi an oblong sbape. Beyond this he has two
remarks to make ol it-one is that the pastores there are so
rich that the covs vill burst, ii they are not driven off from

Agrippa estimated the breadth oi Ireland at 300 miles and
its length at 600. We nov put the breadth at ¹⁷3 and the
length at about apo. Pliny, who has preserved sor us
Agrippa's estimate, adds that the island lies ‘above Britain,’
and is 30 miles distant by the shortest passage from South
Wales'. This is under the mark, for it is a good 40 Roman
miles from St. David Head in Pembroke to Camsore Point
in Wexford.

lost a bulloclr. velue (rs, ou it (clover) last year. It burst. He used to
turn the cattle iu for arr bour every day, and oue day he thought they ought

Jnstin xliv. 4, t ¹4 says ‘Iu alia parte Hispaniae et quae ex insulis consta
reguum penes Geryonem iuit. Iu hac tauta pabuli laetitia est, ut, uisi
abstinentia interpellata sagina fuerit, pecora rumpantur. Inde denique

famae suere, ut Herculem ex Asia praedae magnitudine inlexerint! This =
would supply an adequate motive vvby the two sons oi Neptune, Albiona ³

and Burgyou (Mela itt 78), whom Professor Rhys identifies with Great
Britain and Irelaud, should attaclr Hercules, even though they had to go
to Gallia Narbonensis to do it (Str. iv. r, ς 7, p. 183).
