About this however it will be necessary to speak more
particularly later on.

The number of tbe legions has now mounted to ten, ol which
in the winter of 534 ae. two were located in the country
of the Treviri, two in that of the Lingones, und the remaining
six at Agedincum (vi 44‚§ 3). Their numbers were I, VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV.

In the spring of nc. 52 Caesar brought a reinloroement
(‘ supplementum ') with him hom Italy (vii. 7, ς 5), which we
find aherwards leh in charge ol Labienus' baggage at Agedincum
(ης r). The teu legions already in the lield were divided
between Caesar and LabIenus iu the proportion oi six to the
commander and lour to the lientenant (vii 34, ὁ a). We know
that Vll und XII were with Labienus (vii. 62, ἦ g), and that he
had one legion ol raw recruits, whom he did not uust lor
fighting (Μ a). The two tiro legions were now XIV and
XV. Caesar is hardly likely to have given both these to
Labienus; hence we may reasonably infer that one was with
Labienus and the other with Caesar. With Caesar also were
X (vii. Μ ις 51, ξ 1), VIII (47, ξ 7), and XIII (Μ a), so
that we have only one os Labienus’ legions and two oi Caeser's
left unaccounted for. The 700 men lost at Gergovia (vii. 51,

ξ 4) seem to have belonged mainly to the VIIlth legion (vii 47,

a reinsorcement, which was probably intended to be drahed

to confirm thIs view; lor the location olnire legions is specifically
