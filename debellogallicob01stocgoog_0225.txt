Ol what strength then, were the legions that servcd under
Caesar· in Gaul? At first sight lt seems natural to suppose that
their tull number would be thalos the Madau legion. But
Plutarch evidently did not think thus· We know from Caesar
himself (C. i. 7, 5 7) that he had only one legion with him
when he determined to march on Rome. Now Plutarch twice
tells us (Caes. 3²3 Pomp. 60) that he had not more at that time
than ὄρσο loot and 300 horse. Alter they had been long in¹
the field Caesar's legions, unless reinforeed, naturally fell sar
below this ligure. Thus in the winter ol no 5⁴5 aller the
return from the second expedition to Britain, we lind Caesar
incidentally rechoning two legions (v. 48, i 1)and about roo
cavalry (v. 46, § 4) at 7,οοο men (v. 49, ᾖ 7). This would give
ns &30⁰ soot·soldiers lor each legion. At Pharsalia the
effective strength ol the legion was reduced still lower, owing,
among other causes, to the serious losses at Dyrrhachium. Α

Caesar (C. iii. 89, 5 a) escimstes the eighty cohorts which he
drew up in line at Pharsalia at a sum total of aa,ooo men, which
gives an average of 2⁷5 men lor the cohort or a‚7 50 sor the legion.
Labienus (C. iii. 87) reclrons up lor us tlte causes ol depletion.
'lhere were deaths ln battle, deaths from disense, departureshonn,
and the leaving meu behind invalided. We may regard the
ligure just stated as the ebb-tide in the numerical strength
ol Caesar’s legions Alter Pharsalia he regards it as an instance
ot extreme attenuation tlrat there were only gaso men aplece
iu the two legions which he toolr with him to Alexandria
(C. iii. ronti 1, a.)
