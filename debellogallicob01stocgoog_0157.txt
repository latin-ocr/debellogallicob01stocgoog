and at the same time supplies us with the exact figures by
which that conclusion was reached

Strabo himself does not venture ou any estimate as to the
sine ol Britain, except as regards the south coast, which he
declares to be the longest, and which he tells us is exactly
coextensive with that ol Gaul, the latter being measured from
the mouths ol the Rhine to the northern heights of the Pyrenees
in Aquitania Kent, according to him, was opposite to the
mouths ol the Rhine, and the Land's End to the Pyrenees.
Each coast he says is about 4300 or 4,400 stades (= 550
Roman miles) ¹. In order to understand these extraordinary
statements we must bear in mind that in Strabo's view the coast
ol Gaul ran in one unbrolren line from the Rhine to the
Pyrenees3 he had no idea oi the Bay os Biscay. Moreover he
thought that the Pyrenees ran from south to north and were
pretty nearly parallel to the Rhine (iv. 1, § 1, p. 177 ; cp. iv. a,
51, p. 190).

Pliny takes no notice oi Caesar’s estimate, but says that
Agrippa put the length oi the island at 800 miles and the
hreadth at 300. It does not appear that Agrippa himself ever
visited Britain, but he was more than once in Gaul, and was
ahigh authority on geography, as he made an official map oi
the world (Plin. N. H. iii.§ 17: cp. iv. 5 81).

Tacitus, though he had the advantage of the explorations
made by his father-inlaw Agricola, was too much occupied
with pictoresque description to condescend to stetistics. He is
content to say that it was the largest island known to the
Romans. By the time oi Dio CassiuS, who wrote, not only
alter the conquesta os Agricola, but aller those ol Severus, the
dimensions of Britain ought to have been more exactly
determined But the length of the island is still more
exaggerated by that writer (lxxvi. 12), who puts it at 7,132 stades
(= 891} Roman miles), than it is by Caesar and Agrippa As

¹ Str. ir. 5, ς r, p 199. Cp. 'n p. 63, which is oue of the passages in
which he criticizes Pytheas.
