abries digression from the main subject in order to see how it

came to pass that the Romans encountered Gauls in Asia
Linguistic It would be a great mistake to suppose that iu the centuries
evidence before Christ the Gauls were confinedto France and Italy. On
gfflzt, the west they overflowed into Spain, and on the east they spread

diffusion of the Celtic race irem the ancient names os places.
Just as we can argue to a Roman occupatiori oi Britain in times
past from the many names of places that end in chester, -cester,
and the other disguises os eastra, so we can affirm that the
Gauls must have resided for some considerable time in countries
ι where we find place-names ending in -dunum, -briga, and other
unmistakeably Celtic terminations. The broad fact of an occu·

but as to the exact how and when of their movements our

evidence is confused and conflicting.

Thrace, but the smaliness of their numbers made it advisable
for them to return. This trial-trip however had whetted their

appetite ior plunder. So not long aller they set out again
