exiled by the Carthaginians and his goods confiscated in response
toa Roman embassy (Liv. xxxi. 19).

This victory oi Furius comes in between two deleata, one Operations
in aer, when C. Oppias, the praefect of the allisa, was alain ἓξὲξ ‘¹¹‘
with 7,ooo rnen on a ioraging party in the country of the Boii
(Liv. xxxi. a), another in 199, when the praetor Cn. Baebius

¹ Tamphilus lost more than 6,6eo men in the territory oi the
Insubres (Liv. xxxii. 7). The year following (ac. 198) was
chiefly taken up by the Romana in compelling their coloniole to
retum to Placentia and Cremona (Lis. xxxii 26). ln 197 both
consuls were assigned legions to carry on war against the
Cisalpine Gauls (xxxii. 28) and Liguriana Among the former
we now find the Cenomani, at least the younger members of
the tribe, ranged on the side ol their countrymen. After this
the war went on with varying lonuner, with now some leat of
arms on the part oi a Gallie chieltain, Corolamus or Dordacus
or Boiorix, and again a triumph or thanlrsgiving among the
Romans, until the year 191, when it was terminated, as sar as Triumph
the Gauls were concerned, by the complete submission oi the ἓξὲζξξ
Boii, who were mulcted of about hals their territory (xxxvi 39): Boii.
but the Ligariana, as we have already seen, carried on their
mdmnce to amuch later date. So intimately were they con·
nected in the minda nithe Romanswith the Gauls that when
Scipio Nasica claimed atriumpb sor his cmahing deleat oi the
Boii, a tribune objected to it on the ground that the Gauls
would never be quiet so long as the Ligariana were in arms,
aud that Scipio, instead oi coming horne to claim a triumph,
ought at once to have brought aid to Q. Minucius, who had
been ior three years engaged in a doubtful struggle with the
Liguriam (anui. 39). The tribune however was compelled by
the Senate to withdraw his opposition‚ and Nasica enjoyed
a rich triumph, in which 1471 golchn torques were carried in
processiones well as a quantity oi gold and silver, both in the
form ol coin and bullion, and what are described as fairly
artistic vessels oi nadre worlunanship (Lis. xxxvi. 40).
