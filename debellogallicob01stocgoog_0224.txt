19s CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

stight The importance oi the centurion is apt to make ns think that
{ffl‘m the century also was important as a division ni the anny,
oentury- whereas this was not the case. The word ‘centuria' occms
only twice in Caesur's Commentaries, both times iu the Civil

War, and ‘centuriatim’ once ¹.
ἐξαιρῶ ot With regard to the legion itsell'the chief question to be asked
legion is-How many meu did it contain? Ii any one were to ask
bow many meu there are in an English regimem, it would
he impossible to return a precise and definite answer. The
Romam were a iar more systemmic people tbsn the English:
nevertheless‚ we must not be surprised that the answer to such

a question is a somewhat bary one. We seem ou firm ground

when Polybius (i. 16, i a) begins by telliug us that the Romans
were in the habit of raisiug every year four legions consisting
each oi 4000 font aud 300 horse. But later ou (iit roy,§ ro)
he alters this statement as iar as the horse are concerned,
making the usual number to be aco, but adding that in
emergencies the legion consisted oi gono ioot and 3οο horse.

As this statement is confirmed by Livy (xxii. 36, ς 3), we may
accept it as au improvement on tbe former. This ordinary
legion oi 4000 infantry, which is perhaps a round number ior
μου, was called ‘legio quadrata’ (Festus, p. 336). In the
time oi Marius the normal number of the infantry was raised to
6200. The cavalry are never expressly stated to be more than
300: but ns there were ten ‘turmae’ in the ‘ala' oi Roman
horse, this may again ben round number for 33ο. Iu Appian
Mitb. γε, we get gno horse aa the average oi five legions under
Lucullus.
