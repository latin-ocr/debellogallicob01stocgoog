some to be ol Sabellian origin ¹.
Three The history of the Roman army naturally divides itselt' into
“¹¹ r three perton-
r. The citizen army under the Kings and the early Republic.
a. The army ol the last century ol the Republic
3. The standing army ol the Empire.
The second ol these periods forms merely a transition stage
from the first to the third: but, as it is the period to which
Caesar's army belonged, it is the only one with which we ane
directly concerned. ot the first period we shall touch only on
the close.
Closeot The army, as described by Polybius, consisted oi three

'nerone ‘hastati' occupied the iront rank and were the youngest ol
nam, ue heavy-armed troops, ue ‘marr’ being ue veterane. In
addition to these there were light-armed troops (ι velites'), who
consisted ol the youngest men and were distributed equally
among the three divisione (Polyb vi. 24, 5 4). The number
ol ‘triarii’ was definitely limited to ⁶00; the ‘hastati' and
‘principes' and apparently also the ‘velites' were 1200 each,
which brings the total up to 4²00· Il a larger legion were
required, the additional men were distributed equally among all
the divisione except the ‘triarii' These differed lrom the
‘hastati' and ‘principes' in nol carrying the ‘pilum‘ but being
armed with what Polybius (i ag, ἦ 16) calls δόρατα. Yet tbe
‘triarii’ were otherwise known as ‘pilani'.' Beyond this differ·

thigh, brazen helmets and greaves. The majority wore besides
