CHAPTER VI

GERMANY

lr Britain is interesting to usas the home of our recensendis
Germany ought to be no less so as its cradle. For, though otour ¹²⁰⁸*
many ol the inhabitants ol these islands are Celtic even in
speech to the present day, and though Celtic blood must
have filtered lar beyond the limits of Celtic language, yet in

the blend which constitutes the modern Briton it is the Teutonic
clement, whether low-German or scandinavian, that gives tone
and body to the whole. Could Caesar have loreseen that later
generations ol Teutonic boys, instead ol running wild in the
woods, would be studying his Commentarios as a text-hook, he
might have endeavoured to satisty our curiosity more sully than
he has done as to what manner oi meu our ancestors were.
But, inasrtmh as the world was not constructed with a view
to our convenience in the way ol acquiring knowledge, we
must be thanklul for Caesar's hasty impressions of Germany
and the Germans, gathered in his lew weeks' stay across the
Rhiue¹.
litter Germany had become better known to the Romans Tacitus on
through military operatione which were on the whole unsuccesslul‚ Germany.
