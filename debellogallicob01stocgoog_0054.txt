22 . CAESAR'S cantic WAR

one and invited the other to dinner. Itis this side of his
character, so eloquently celebrated by Sallust, even more than

his magnificent abilities, that has thrown such a charm and
glamour over the person of Caesar. Caesar could be swift aud

terrible in retribution, as when he laept his word to the pirates
and hanged thern every one3 but he refused to cherish raucoru
himself, and disarmed rancour in others Even the men witlr

Sovereign Pontiff was a follower of the Epicurean philosophy
and a disbeliever in Divine Providence He certainly dwells
much in hia own works on the power of fortune in war (see
iv. 26,§ 5 n), and ascribes the course of the world to that agency
iu the speech which is put into his mouth by Sallust (Cat 51,
ξ 25). But all the same, he refers in quite an edifying way to

the linger of heaven as displayed in the chastisement of his
