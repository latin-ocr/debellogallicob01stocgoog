ramparts '; Ambarri (=Ambiarari), the dwellers on both banis
ol the Arar. The names oi places in the same way yield a
meaning under the comparative method. Briha, which occurs
at the end os so many names oi towns, means ‘ford’ as in
Samarobriva, ‘the iord of the Somme.' Magus, another
common termination, means a field, as in Rigomagus, ‘the
king's field? Briga is a burg or stronghold; dunum a hill-
iortress, as in Noviodunum (=Newcastle), Uxellodunum,
Vellaunodunum durias a iortress, as in Octodurus.

We muw inquire now into the physical characteristica os the siae osche
people who spolie this language. Μ’·

The first thing that struck a Greek or Roman observet about
the Ganls was their siae. Caesar has commented on this
(ii. Μ 4), and so have all the writers who deal with them
(eg. D. S. v. 28, ς r; Α. Μ. xv. ης 13 Paus. x. ao, i 4).
llor was this sine in one dimension only, their bodies being apt
to become bloated by too much indulgence in sood and drink,
though at an earlier period, according to Ephorus, they fought
against this tendency, having a certain measure oi girth, which
the young men were punished ii they exeeeded (Str. iv. 4, § 6,
ad tin; App. iv. 7). We hear also os the moist white flesh
of the Gauls¹ in contrast with that oi the southern nations, who
were spare, dark men. These physical characteristica os the
Gauls put them at a disadvantage in one respect in combating
the wiry Romans. Roman endurance took the shape oi a
toleranee oi heat, dust, and thirst, which were just the things
which the Gauls were least able to bear. They soon lost breath
and began to run with sweat. Their bodies, it was observed,
had something about them of the snows oi their own Alps,
and melted under the heat oi the sun (Flor. i. ao).

The Ancients had a respectful admiration for the women os Their
the Ganls, who are described as large and sair, and brave and women.
