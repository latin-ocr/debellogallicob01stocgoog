Germans, and, notwithstanding the apparent strength of Trajan's
empire, the historian ina prophetie moment declares that it was
only the discord os their enemies that secured the Romans srorn
destruction. The question has been raised whether Tacitus
himself had any direct acquaintance with Germany. We may
iairly suspect that at all events the account of the altercation
between Flavius and Arminius (n i. 9, ιο) was not based on

Mela (iii. 55 24, 29) speaks oi great lakes in Germany.

the plains of Upper Germany were covered witha kind oi wild
