pains to secure the best specimens.

But ii the Romans were disappointed iu the pearls of Britain,
they were compensated hythe excellence oi the mollusc that
produced them. The oysters ot‘ Britain became famous under
the Empire‚ and were held to surpass in flavour even those os
the Lucrine lake. Everyone will remember the gounuand in
Juvenal (Sat iv. 14o-a)‚ who was slrilled to detect at the first bite
whether a given oyster was a native oi Circeii or came from

xxxvii. ξ 35)
