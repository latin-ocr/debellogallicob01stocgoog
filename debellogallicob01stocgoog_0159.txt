(ru. a, § a), Strabo puts it at 3²0 stades or 40 Roman miles.
lt is this passage which Strabo is really referring to when be

utks ol the passage from the Rhioe. He explains at last that
ἵ ὶιι starting from the neighbourhood ol that river people did not
actually sail from the mouth, butirum the country ol the
Morini, iu which was Itium (iv. 5, § a, p. 199).

'lhe statements of Diodorus Siculus on this subject are more

* correct and less confusing than those of Strabo. The island,

³ he says, lies obliquely along the coast os Europe. It has three
promontories, Cantium, ‘where the sea makes its outllow,'
Belerium (ie. the Land's Eud) at the other extremity, and

t athird, which runs out into the ocean and is called Oreas ¹.

The distance across the Straits ol Do‘ver is understated by

, Diodorus, who makes it only 100 stades or ra} Roman miles ;

buthe says that Belerium is four days' sail from the Continent.

Mela (iii. ς 50) says that Britain lies to the north-west, that it
has a great comer facing the mouths of the Rhine‚ and that
theu the sides go back obliquely, one ol them looking towards

Ἴ Gaul, the other towards Germany, and finally form two more
¹ angles with the third side, so that the whole island is very like

Sicily. He tells us also that Europe is bounded on the north
hythe British Ocean (ἰᾷ 15), aud that the Pyreneus run into
this ocean (ii. ς 85). Pliny (rv.§ roa) speaks to much the same
effect, but adds that Britain lies ‘opposite at a great distance,
to Germany, Gaul, Spain, and by far the greatest parts ol
Europe! The term ‘British Ocean' is confined by Pliny
(ir. § 109)ῐο the sea between the Scine and the Rhine‚

That Diodorus Siculus and, to some extent, Strabo should
ignore Caesar's views is only part ot the systematic neglect os
Roman writers by the Greeks. One may read through some
of the Greek authors under the Empire without ever being
reminded that there was such a thing as Roman literature.
But it is more surprising that Pliny, in spite ol Caesar's precise

statement of the length of the passage lrom Gaul to Britain, ·
