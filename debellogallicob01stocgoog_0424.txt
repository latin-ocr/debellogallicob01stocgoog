160 C. IULH CAESARIS

But the soldiers stood firm and the centurione vied with one
another in displayiug their valour upon tbe mellente.

Many attempta had been made to communicate with Caesar.
At last a Gaul, himself a N aviae, who was in the eemp, employed
his servant to carry a despatch eoneealed in a spear.

 

Caesar was at Samarobriva, though be forgets to sayso. The ,

news reached him an hour before nightfall. He at onoe sent
a messenger to M. Crassus, whose quarters were twenty-five miles
oti, in the country of the Bellovaci, ordering the legion to start at
midnight and come to him Α second messenger was despatched
to C. F abius bringing him instructions to march his legion into the
country of the Atrebates so as to jein Caesar on the way. Dis·
medonary orders were also sent to Labienus to come into the

territory of the Nervii, but, being himself threatened by the ¹

Treveri, that commender thought it advisable not to stit. About η

the third bour next day couriers arrived announeing the approach

of Crassus. Leaving him in charge of the head-quartem at ,
Samarobriva, Caesar hastened by foreed marchas into the territory
of the Nervii, having with him one legion and pieking up that of 2

Fabius on the way: he had also collected about 4ου cavalry.
N ews of his coming was eonveyed to Cioero by a Gallie hersemar,
who hurled a spear into the camp with a despatch attached to the

third day, when the joyful news it contained was confirmed by

the smolre in the distance which marked the devastating advanoe
of the Roman army.

The Gauls now raised the siege and advaneed with all their
forces against Caesar. The latter, warned hy Cicero of his danger,

entrenched himself in a safe position in an ostentatiously small r

camp. Then hythe usual Roman taetics of playing on the aelf·
confidence of the Gauls he &ew thern into an attaelr on his camp,
and hy a sudden sally routed them with great slaugbter.

The same day Caesar arrived in the camp of Cicero and praised
him and the legion for their gallant conduct On the next he
called the soldiers together and consoled them for the loss of their

corni-ades under Sabinus and Cotta hythe thought that they bad
now avenged it ².
