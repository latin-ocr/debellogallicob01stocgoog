town of which the remains are still to be seen ou the flat top of
a hill, six kilomltres south of Clerrnont·Ferrand. Vercingetorix
had had all the bridges broken down and kept marching along the
opposite bank, to prevent the Roman general from constructing
one for himself. Caesar however managed to evade the vigilance
ni his antagonist by biding two of his legions in a wood‚ while he
sent on the other four, so swelled out by captives as to resemble
the whole number, in order to draw the enemy after them. One

been bribed by the Arvernians and had concerted a plot with some
young noblemen, chief among whom were Litaviccus and his ³
