PREFACE ix

has done me a similar service with respect to Kampen's

maps and pians.
I might go on to mention the kindness that has been

shown to me by F rench scholare, were 1 vain enough to
think that this utterance would be heard across the
Channel. But l cannot forbear to mention the name of
Monsieur Max Bonnet, Professor of Latinat Montpeliicr,
who left nothing undone to render my visit to France
as instructive as it was delightful.

1 have hed before to make acknowledgements to
hir. C. S. Jerram for his kindness in correcting proofs
for me. lt is no slight testimony of friendship that he
hes revised every proof from the beginning of the work
to the end. To come neerer home still, 1 am indebted
to my wife for the arrangement of the grammatical index.
Here it might seem natural to stop, did not justice
nggest that there is one acknowledgemeot which has
been omitted, and that is to the Reader at the Clarendon
ΡΜ, a person-if he be indeed a person, and not
aprinciple of exactitude-of concealed identity, but ,
of manifest attainments. ’
