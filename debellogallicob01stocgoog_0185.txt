The intense individualism too which marks the modern
Englishman has come down to him from the free German,
who did not live in towns, but at most in straggling hamlets,
where every man's house was separated by a space from his
neighbour’s (G. 16, ἧς 1, a), and whose liberty degenerated

into licence when he came in at bis own sweet will a day or two ’

scrupulous care with which debts of honour were paid,
insomuch that the younger and stronger, when he had lost

his all, would allow himself to be bound and sold into slavery. Ι

nearly we are touched by what relates to the Germana is best
brought home to us when we find the name ol Englishman
making its first appearance on the field ol history in the
