DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ, V 161

· News travelledfast iuGaul. The campoi Cicero was sixtymiles
frorn that of Labienus. Caesar did not reach it till the ninth hour
of the day, yet before midnight the Remi were congratulating
Labienus on Caesar's victory. The tidings had the effect of
deterring Indutiomarus from an attack upon the campos Labienus,
which he had planned for the very next day.

Caesar seems to have taken Cicero's legion back with him, for,
owing to the disturbed state of the country, he wintered at Amiens ·
with three legions in three separate camps, and the camps, it is
claimed, are there to this day. Fabius was sent back to his old
quarters.

This winter was very unquiet. The Senones followed the

example of the Carnutes in expelling a king who was a nominee
of Caesar3 no states could be trusted bnt the Aedui and Remi ; the
Treveri under Indutiomarus were especially active in organizing

rebellion. All the patriotism of the country was gathering round
the chieftain of the Treveri, who might have played the part of
Vercingetorix, had he not fallen a victim to the craft of Labienus,
who set a price upon his head. Alter his death Caesar found Gaul
a little more quiet.
