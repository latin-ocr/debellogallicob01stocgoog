ami us. The exiled Camillus, we are told, appeared on the scene in time

to save Rome from the last degradation of paying her ransom
in gold. With the aid of the men of Ardea and of the Romans

who had fled to Veii, he defeated the Gauls amid the ndns of
the city, and on the following day, eight miles off, on the rond

to Gabii. But their numbers had already been decimated by
disease contracted during their long stay under the burning sun
of Rome amid the stifling ashes of a ruiued city. They had got
tired of burying their dead singly, and had corne at last to
heaping them together in what was afterwards known as the
Busta Gallica (Lis. v. 48, 53: xxii. 14, § rr). Flrst impres-
sions count for much; and this rude experience which the
Romans had of the Gauls inspired them with an enduring terror
of these formidable adversaries, who, with their giam limbo and
huge weapons, seemed created for the destruction of men and
the devastationes cities (Flor. i. 7, ξ 4). The word ‘tumultus'
which was especially used of danger from the Gauls, is explained
by Cicero (Phil. viii. ξ 33 ep. Serv. onVerg. Aen viii. ι) to be
acontraction from ‘timor multus! The derivation is no more
successful thau those of the Ancients generally, hut it serves to
illustrate our point When a ‘tumultus' was proelaimed, no
exemptions from service were allowed to hold good¹, but all
who wished their country to be safe were bound to follow their
general. This proclamation was only made in the case of an
Italian or Gallie foe.

After the disappearance of the Senones, Rome had rest from
the Gauls for twenty-three years: but in 367 s. c. they appeared
again, and Camillus was appointed to his fifth dictatorship to
cope with them This he did successfully, and the enemy were
dispersed into Apulia. The weterau general triumphed at the
age of eighty, and died two years later (Liv. wi. 42: vii. 1, ξ 8;
App. iv. ι).
