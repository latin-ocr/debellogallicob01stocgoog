DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ. ff 65

Celtic Gaul, who remained ever after his most faithful allies. They
denied that they had taken any part in the confederation them-
selves, but declared that all the rest of the Belgae were in arms at
well as the Gennan tribes who dwelt on the near side of the Rhine
This statement must be taken with a slight qualification, for neither
the Mediomatrici, Treveri, or leuci seem to have played any part
in the war. From the Remi Caesar was able to procure stetistics
as to the contingente promised by the various tribes. He was

The position taken up by Caesar was naturally a strong one, as
