154 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

Germania. Of the position of the Angli, or, as they are here
called, Anglii (G. 4ο, § ι), Tacitus can only vaguely tell us
that they lived somewbere beyond the Langobardi. Ptolemy
(ii. rr, ς 15), who calls tbem Ἀγγιιλοῐ, is more precise, placing
them eastward of the Langobardi arrd on the middle reaches
oi the Elbe. He speaks of them as an important people and
a brancb of the Suebi. The Saxons are placed by the same
geographer (ii. 11, ξ ιι) between the Elbe and the neck
ol the Cimbric Chersoneso, that ia, in what is now ealled
Holstein.

The accounts then which Caesar and other writers give oi
the Germane concern us at least as much as those oi Britain,
and in dealing with the great German race we are going back
to the root whence we were hewn.

To Caesar Germany was simply the country beyond the
Rhine: be does not attempt to assign its boundaries or to

Nomea- estimato its siae. He tellsus us(vi. 25, ξι) that the Germana
dr sterce themselves had no measuresol distance, and could only estimato
⁸³¹⁰ ngthe the length os a journey by the time it took a ligbtly equipped
G 'traveller to perform rt. One rs reminded of this remark ol our
author in certain parts of Germany at the present day, as, lor
instance, in the Saron Switzerland and the adjacent parts of
Bohemia‚ where the sign-posts announce only the number
oi hours and minutas from one salient point to another,
though the English tourist is apt to conclude that these

measures are not based on the walking powers ol an expeditus.

nonnemo Mela (ις 19) tells us that the Germana reach as iar as the
ᾖξ’ Sarmatae, and then on to Asia. He makes their country to

be bounded on the west by the Rhine, on the south by the
Alps, on the east by the borders of the Sarmatae, and on tbe
north by the Ocean (rii.§ 25). Thia roughly coincides witb
ι what is said by Tacitus (G. 1,§ ι), that Germany is divided
from the Gauls by the Rhine, from the Raetians (who lived
in the Alps, Str. vii. r,§ 5) and Pannonians by the Danube,
from the Dacians by mountains, and from the Sarmatae by
