ὑσσόι, probably an onomatopoetic word representing the ‘biss’
of the weapon as it llew through the air, and is described by

Polybius (vi. 23, §59-11), by Dionysius oi Halicarnassus (v. 46),
by Plutarch (illarius 25), and by Appian (iv. ry Dionysius,
who lived nearest to the time oi Caesar, describes it as con·
sisting oi a long and massive shall, from the end ol which there
projected an iron epit, not less than three leet long. With the
exception of the head the spit was of soll iron, so as to bend
vrhen it had lodged in its mark, and not only trammel the
enemy, but be useless lor retum. This describes the general
type of the weapon ss seen in the specimens which have been
preserved to us, but it varied of course at different periods‚ and
even at the same period all ‘pila' were not alike. Polybius
says that the soldiers carried two—one beavy and one light,
but that in all cases the length of the shsit was 3 cubits
(πή leet), and the length ol the iron the mnne, only that part
ol it was hidden in the shait Of the more massive kind, be
tells us, some had a round and others a square sbast, apalm
(=3 inches) in diameter or ‘superficies' Such a weapon as
this could hardly be used in ordinary fighting, but it might be
launched with great effect srom a height, and so maycorrespond
to what Caesar calls ‘muralia pila' (v. 40, ξ 6: vii. 82,§ 1).
Up to the time ol Marius the ‘pilum’ was confined to the
‘hastati’ and ‘principes’ the ‘triarii’ being armed with the
‘hasta’ Before the battle of Vercellae Marius is recorded to
have devised a means of still more effectually attaining the
result desired with regard to the ‘pilum' Taking out one of
the two iron rivets, with which the shanlr was attached to the
shaft, he inserted instead a wooden peg, which would easily
break and let the weapon hang sideways, thus making it difficult
to draw it out (Plut. Mar. 25). Caesar seems to have trusted
to the bending oi the iron to produce this hampering effect
upon the foe (i. 25, ξ 3). The ‘pilum' had a spike at the lower
end, so that it could be fixed into the ground ¹.
