lt used to be thought that Auum (the ‘Augustodunum' ol rae
Ann. iii. 43lwas itoelt'the Bibracte ol Caesar. But we had to do
twenty kilometreo ot very uphill work before we got to St. Leger
sona Beuvray‚ and then live kilomttres more ol a still steeper
hillside before we began the actutd ascent ol the mountain. By
this time the hind wheel ol' my bicyde had shed most ol its
spoken and my companion perceived it to be bending like an S as

which was plausible at first, but eventually brought us into a moraes,
and afterwards into a dense jungle ol nettles and bramblee. Alter

man who dropped unsolicited the remark that M. Bulliot was in the
cottage which we had Just passed. Here was a reward for per·

panorama from a spot where there stands a monument corn·
