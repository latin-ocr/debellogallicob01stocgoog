2³0 CAESAR'S osam WAR

as much again (⁸ sesquiplex stipendium') as that oi the common
soldier, and Polybius (vi. 39, i ra) tells us that the Roman
knight received triple pay, which would he double that ol the
praetorian cohort This gives point to the remark ol the vag
in the tenth legion, who declared that Caesar, in mounting it,
vras doing more than he promised (i 42, ς 6). Caeam does ¹
not seem to have had a regular praetorian cohort at all, bnt
it was quite a usual thing at this period Petreius, acting as
‘legatus' to C. Antonius, had one in the engagement wirh ,
Catilius (Sall. Cat. 60, ξ 5); afterwards, vhen he fought against ,
Caesar in Spain, he had oue on his own account (C. i. 75, 5 a).
Each member ol the second triumvirate, Octavian, Mark antony,
and Lepidus, had his special praetorian cohort (App. Civ. iv. 7),
so had Silanus and Hirtius (Cic. Fam. a. 30, i 1); so even had
Cicero in his varlilre exploits in Cilicia (Fam xv. 4, 5 7). This
was the germ out ol vhich vvere developed the Praetorians or
household troops at Rome under the Empire.

proper officer in the centurion. Hence the juxnposition ol
‘centurio' end ‘manipulares sui¹.’ ln the pre-Marian army
each of the three divisione, ‘hastati’ ‘principes' and {triarii}
vias divided into ten parta, thus giving the thirty maniples which
made up the legion, exclusive ol the ¹ velites' assigned to each
(Polyb. vl. 24, i ³)- The oohort is supposed to have oonsined
oi a maniple hom each division.
