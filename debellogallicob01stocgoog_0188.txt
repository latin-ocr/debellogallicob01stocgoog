The

were wrapped in mystery and a region os fable. We are told
oi islanda in the Baltic where there were men with horses' legs,
who were called HippopodeS, and of others where the inhabi-
tants had no covering ior their bodies but their own ample ears
(Mela iii. ξ 5⁶5 Plin. iv. ς 95; Tac· G. 46, ξ 6).

With regard to the general character of the country Caesar
does not tell us much, because he does not know much. One
thing, as a practical man, he lelt quite sure of, namely, that the
soil oi Germany was not to be compared with that oi Gaul
(i. gr, ὁ rr: cp. 29, §4l—elsc why the extreme readiness oi

turning to the len, but it is rather the Danube which at this
point takes a eharp turn to the right, flowing for a time due
south, instead of east. The mention by Caesar (vi. 25, § a) oi
ao obscure a people as the Anartes stamps the passage as being
derived from tbe professed geographer Eratosthenes. We hear
