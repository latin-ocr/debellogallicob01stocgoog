alleged extent ol his travels was incredible to begin with, seeing
that he was a private person and a poor man. ‘Even Hermes
himself: added the historian, ‘could not be believed, it be said
that he bad travelled so sar! ln answer to this objection it
has been conjectured by modern writers that Pytheas may have
been sent out at the expense ol the Massilian state, as Hanno
and Himilco were by Carthago. Strabo seldom mentions the
famous navigator without a sneer, and has no keener con-
troversial tbtust to make at awriter whose views heis criticizing
than to say that ‘he had believed Pytheas ¹! He classes him
(p. 102) along with Euhemerus and Antiphanes' as a proles·
sional impostor, adding in another place (p. ²95) that he bad
used his knowledge ol astronomy and mathematics to obtain
credenee lor fiction. As regards Thule Strabo himself lays
claim to no knowledge, but assumes that Pytheas mus have
lied about it, because be had lied about places better known
(iv. 5, 5 5, p. ποι). But when we come to inquire into the
specillo charges laid by Strabo against Pytheas it is surprising
how little we can find to justily all this censure. One mis·
statement which he brings home to him is that the length of

which is certainly an enorrnotts exaggeration. Another is that

do not know from what point he deserted the coast ol Gaul
and made across to Britain.

In writing about Britain it is not necessary to go into the
vexed question ol Thule. Suffice it to say that Pytheas spoke
ol a country under that name as being ‘six days’ sail to the
