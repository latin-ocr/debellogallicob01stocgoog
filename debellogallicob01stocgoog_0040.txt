acting at a distance srom his superior Caesar takes care to give
him lull credit for his achievements, as he does to all the officers
who acted under him. In the matter of the Usipetes and
Tencteri Caesar has not mis-stated or concealed the laets. What
he has done is to seelr to palliate his own conduct byattributing
atreacherous motive to his antagonists. Oi this we have no
prool but Caesar's bare assertion‚ and it appears extremely

improbable from the facts as related by himself.

Eunogra- When we turn from the actual history of Caesar's campaigns

{ffissff to the ethnographical and geographical notices which lend so

calnotioes. much charm to his writings, we find ourselves much better
supplied with extraneous information.

Diodorus The author nearest to Caesar's own time is Diodorus Siculus.

Siculus. He is supposed to have written aller the year nn. 8, but his lile
overlapped that ol Caesar, as he speaks of having been alive
himself when Caesar built the bridge across the Rhine (v. 25,
§4). His ‘Historical Library‚' which bas come down to us
only in part, seems to have stopped short of Caesar's Gallie War.
We may surmise that the work was interrupted by death, as
he twice expresses the intention to treat of Caesar's invasion ol
Britain (v. ar, ξ a; aa,§ r). But in the fifth book, which is
extant, and which deals mainly with islanda, he bas len us an
account ol Britain and of its trade in tin (cha aa, 23). Fortu·
nately for us also he has thought it suitable to his design to
throw in an account ol Gaul and its inhabitants (ebs. 24-32)

Strabo’s birth is put at about nc. 66, so that bis liie also

overlapped that ol Caesar. But he wrote during the early years
oi the reign of Tiberius, as is evident irorn many allusions ¹. His
treatise on geography is by lar the most valuable worlr os the
kind that has corne down to us from antiquity. The first four

chapters of the fourth book are devoted to TransalpineGau13
