effective after-dinner speaker, if only he could have got out
on the spur of the moment the things that occurred to him
afterwards when he was going home in his oab. This great
advantage is possessed by all the characters of antiquity, down
to the merest satages, that they are credited with having said
impromptu whatever could be devised for them by the most

brilliant writer in his study. For the speeches were the tield
in which the historlan displayed his wit or the want of it,
and in which he let it he scen how much he had profited
by those rhetorical exercises which formed the staplc of
educedon among the Ancients. If there happened to be
abaris of recorded speech to go upon, the writer might as well
derlve s happy sentiment from that source as hom another;
but the direct aim in these compositione was not historic truth
but mametis propriety, or what the writer, if he were a dull
man, mistook for the latter. Dio Cassius hsd before him the
brief bot vigorous speech which Caesar recorda himself to have
addressed to his officere before the engagement with Ariovistus
¹ (B. G. i. 4ο); nevertheless he thinks proper to put into his
mouth an interminsble hamngue (mviii. 36-46) which, with
its review of the ware of Rome and its imitatione of Demosthenes,
bears not the slightest resemblance to the original, except the
touch about the tenth legion at the end.

The speeches ln Caesar are almost entirely in the oblique
oration, a form of composition which, while detracting from
their vividness, imparts at the same time an air of vensimilitude‚
ss though they were reports of what had actually been said,
as no doubt they to some extent were. The only important
speech which is given in the direct oration is that of Critognatns
(B. G. vii 77), during the siege of Alesia, which Caesar could
not pretend to have heard Other small bits of direct oration
are introduced for liveliness‚ asin v. 30 ς 44 ς 3: vi. 8, §i 3, 4 3
