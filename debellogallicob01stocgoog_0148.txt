Spain, says that they are ten in number, and definitely places ,
them in the Western Ocean as opposed to the Cantabriau, or 2

longitude (on his own system) oi the middle one.

This review oi the evidenoe has served to show us that in the Ῐ

minds oi the ancient writers tbe Cassiteridas had nothing to f

do with Britain, except in so sar as Britain itseli'was assumed ,

to be near Spain. We thus seem driven to the alternative Α
view, adopted by Sir Charles Elton, that the Cassiteridas

were tbe small islanda that iringe the Bay oi Vigo ¹. But ,
this view labours under great difficulties. For, if we are to ,

accept the account oi Strabo, only one oi the ten was a desert
isle, the rest being inhabited by men who wore black cloaks,

breasts‚ who walked about with staves, looking like the Furies .
