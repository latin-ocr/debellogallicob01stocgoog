practice is ‘that they may not build too scientifically with aview
to avoiding extremes of cold and heat' Strabo (viii. r, 5 3)

corroborates this account by saying‚ ‘Areadiness to change
their abode is characteristic ol all the people in these parts, ’

owing to the sinrplicity ol their lite, and owing to their not
tilling the ground, nor gathering in harvests, but dwelling in
huts with such sumiture as suffices sor daily needa And their

subsistencc is in the main derived from flocks and herds, as in r

the case ol the Nomads: so that in imitation of them they
hoist their homes on wagons and betalre themselves where they
will with their cattle.¹

Strabo, we must remember, is one ol our very best wimesses

as to the early state os Germany‚ for he lived through the Ἴ

campaigns oi Tiberius, Drusus, and Germanicus, which was
just the period when the Roman acquaintance with the country
was at its maximum. He recorda, and may have himself
witnessed, the brilliant triumphos the last-named general, at
which the traitor Segestes was present as an honoured witness
os the ignominy of hia nearest and dearest.

. Aa the life oi the Germana was thus pastoral rather than

agricultural, it is not surprising that their sood should consist
pn‘ncipahy ol milk, cheese, and meat (vi. aa, § ι), and that corn
should play but a minor part in their diet (iv. r, ξ 8). Os the
beer described by Tacitus (G. 23) Caesar has nothing to say.
He merely notes the absence of wine and the prohibition
against its import among the Nervii (ii. 15, i 4) and Suebi
(iv. a, i 6). Posidonius, who wrote before Caesar, speaks of
the Germana lunching oli roasi meat from the joint andwashing
it down with their ‘wine' neat ¹. By this we may understand
him to mean beer. In the time of Tacitus the tribes nearest to
the Rhine bought the forbidden liquor srom the merchants.
