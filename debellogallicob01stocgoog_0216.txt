From another poet, Lucilius, we guther that the ‘veles' was
the same as the ‘rorarios' that he carried five ‘hastae' and.
wore a golden belt-

¹innqne bastae, aureolo cinctu rorarln’ velea'

We may also fairly infer his identity with the ‘accensus velatus'
from another line oi the same author-

‘Pone paludatus stabat rorarlo’ velox:

though we are under no necessity of connecting ‘veles' ety-
mologioally with ‘velatus'

These nimble light infantry were oi special use against
elephanta. We find them so employed in the First Punic War
(Polyb. i. 33, 59), at the battle oi the Trebia (nc. 218, Liv. xxi.
55, §ul and again (Liv. xxx. 33, 53) at Zama (nc. τοι),
where they were posted in the gaps between the maniples, to
tempt the beasts under a double fire. On ordinary occasions
the ‘velites' were stationed partly among the ‘antesigani' and
partly behind the standards ¹.

The ‘velites' are called by Polybius γροσφομόχοι (i. 33, 5 9;
vi. ΜΛ 7) or γροσφοφόροι (vi. ar, l 9), andare described by
him much in the same way as they are by Livy as carrying
a round buekler (πάρμη), three ieet in diameter, and being
armed with a swerd, and with light spears (γρόσφοι). He adds
that their head-gear was generally plain, but occasionally covered
with wolf-skin, partly sor protection, and partly to draw the
attention of the officers, and let them see whether they were
playing their part manfully. The γρόσφος or ‘hasta' is described
by him as having a shall three ieet long and oi a finger's breadth
aad a point aspan long, so attenuated as to break at the first
cast and prove useless to the enemy.
