Ἴ uses russin, and Galen (xv. 185) goes out ol his way to say that
η tlte Germane were not &⁰⁶⁰1 but πυρροί. It seems then that we
l ought not to think of the hair oi the ancient Gemens as ol the
same light blonde oolour as that of tbe modern Swede. But we
must remember that the prevailing hue was to a great extent
artificial. We haue seeu already (p. 94) that the Gauls took
care that their children’s looks should conform to the regulation
type oi ruddy gold3 and the Germana imitated their practice in
κ this particular. Pliny (N. H. xxvii § 191) informs us that the
’ Gauls invented a soap lor turning the hair golden (‘ rutilandis
, capillis ’) ¹, aud that this was more used among the Germane by
¹ the men than by the women. It was a decoction ol suet and
woodashes, the best ior the purpose being beech or hombeam‚
³ anomrgstnundernerrnauqnnorsourtorm. The use or

this dyc passed from the barbarians to the Roman ladies, among
whom it appears to bave been known as ‘spuma Batava².'

χ But il we oaunot demet much differente in kind, physically Grester
speaking, between the Gauls and Gemitus, there was at aum&

events a differem in degree. Il the Gauls were big, the
, Germana were still bigger. Caesar (iv. 1, l 9) ascribes the siae
aud strength ol the latter to their meat diet and their daily

exercise, adding, whimsically enough, the absence ol all restraint
from their childbood. One os the restraints with which the

young German was in no way -hampered was clothes. ‘ln
l every bouse‚' says Tacitus, ¹ naked and dirty, they attain to that
length of limb and that bulk ol body which we admire⁸.'
