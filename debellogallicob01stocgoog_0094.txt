62 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

shore 01 the Hellespont, and they were tantalised by the daily
sight 01 Α313 across the narrow strip 01 water. A new quarrel
broke out at this point, in consequence 01 which Leonorius with
the bullr oi the army went back to Bycentium. Lutarius how-
ever seized two decked vessels and three boats belonging to
some Macedonian ambassadom, and by plying them across the
strait night and day succeeded in transporting the whole 01 his
force. Not long afterwards Ieonorius (Str. xii. 5, § ι) 3130
crossed irom Byzantium with the aid 01 Nicomedes, king 01
Bithynia The two chiehains now reunited their forces, and
served under Nicomedes against his brother Zyboetas, whom
they dispossessed 01 his portion oi the kingdom. After this the
Gauls had 3 high time 01 itin Asia It was 33 though 3 pach
01 wolves had obtained entranoe into a sheepfold Not more
than ro,ooo out 01 the 30000 were armed, but these sufficed to
terrorise 311 the inhabitants on this side 01 the Taurus3 besides
which, their numbers in 3 few generations rapidly increased.
Every people submitted to their exactione, even the kings 01
Syria at last paid them tribute, and no prince went to war
without hiring the Gauls, for fear he should find them hired
against him. Lest they should quarrel among themselves they
wisely agreed to divide the spoil. There were three tribes 01
them-the Tolistobogii‚ Trocmi, and Tectosages 01 the
Tolistobogii and Trocmi we know no more than we do 01
the Prausi, to whom Brennus is said to have belonged (Str. iv.
p. 188), but the Tectosages had their original home at Toulouse,
being one branch 01 the Volcae, and were to be found also in
Caesar’s time in the Hercynian iorest (vi. 34, §i 3, 3). To the
Trocmi the shore 01 the Hellespont was assigned 33 tributary,
to the Tolistobogii Aeolia and Ionia. and to the Tectosages the
inland parts. Attalus, king 01 Pergamus (3. 0. 341-197), was the
first to resist this intolerable domination 5 he drove the Gsuls
into the hiterior, but did not break their power (Pausi 8, i 2).
Alter this they were confined to the neighbourhood 01 the Halys
and Sangarius.
