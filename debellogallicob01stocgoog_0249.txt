Cic. Cat. i. ξ ar).

Tbere were other standards besides the engle, which are Other

confused under the general name os ‘signa' The bearet os mm·
one os these was called ‘signifer' (it 25,§ r: C. iii ⁸14,§ 1).
It is plain lrom the former oi these passages¹ that each cohort
had its own standard ¹. At the' same nme there ere passages
where ‘signum' must be understood ol the standard oi the
maniple ⁸. lt is possible that the seperate standard lor the cohort
only came in with the Marian organisation. We may notice
that the term used by Polybius lor standard-bearem is σημωωφόροι
(vi. 24, ς 6), and that σημαία is his word both for ‘maniplo' and
ior ‘standard' (ii. 32, l 6). When Caesar (C. iii. 99, ξ 4) tells
us that aiter Pharsalia there were brought in to him 180 ⁶ signa
militaria' and nine eagles, it is impossible to confine the former
to the standards oi cohorte.

A ‘signum' was a graven image ol some kind, and must be stege

distinguished from ‘vexillum’ which was more like a dag.
When the soldiers saw a red ‘vexillum' holsted over the
generals tent, they knew that they must rusb to arms (ii. ao,
5 r n). Another kind oi ‘vexillum' isdescribed by Dio Cassius
(xl. 18, 5 3) as inscribed with purple letters indicating the army
and the general. This is in connexion with the ill-iated Parthian
expedition of Crassus (nc. 53), and so we may suppose that
such dags were in Caesar¹s camp also Dio Cassius speaks

A body ol men undere special commender, who did not
belong to the force with which they were serving, would have
a‘vexillum' lor their ensign. Thus the goo ⁴convalescent
