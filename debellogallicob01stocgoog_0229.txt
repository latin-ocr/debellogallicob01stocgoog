But now a difficulty emergas. For in viii. 4, 5 3 Hirtius Difficutty
. mentions a legion VI, which we bave never heard of before, 1²32&
and mentions it too ln a way which shows that it was one of
ἶ tlrose engaged in the siege of Alesia (cp. vii. 90, 5 8).
Napoleon 111 surmises (vol. ii. p. 357, n.) ‘that it had remained
ι in garrison among the Allobroges or ln Italy’3 Gdler (i. 333)
, suggests that vt is here a mIstalre for I. On me whole perhaps
we should do better to follow the latter view. Only there is no
f need to suppose a mistalre. There is no mention in Caesar’s
' narrative of legion 1. 'Ibe sole mention we have of it is by
Hirtius (viii. 54, 5 a), who is speaking for the moment from the
point of view of Pompeius, arrd doubtleas gives it the number
which it bore in the army of that general. lf we accept this
identification of l and VI, wc are relleved fruman awkward
breach of continuity and have an uninterrupted series of ten
legions in Caesar's army from VI to XV. Another presumption
2 iu favour of thIs hypothesis is that, if Caesar, as we have seen
1 reason auertere, nar orry legion xrr otu armar at arsace,
κ there is no room for legion l in the account oi winter-quartem
in vii. 903 since by a comparIson of texts we can assign their
³ proper legions to the several commandere For his expedition
¹ against the Bellovaci Caesar drew two legions from Fabius,
which vere all he bad, and one of his two from Labienus
(viii. ⁶, 5 3). These three legions we find were VII, VIII, and
. lX (viii. 8, 5a). Let us suppose that VII and VIII came from
Fabius. This leaves IX to Labienus, and we know that his
other legion was XV (viii. 24, 5 3). C. Antistius Reginus had
X15vii. 90, 5 7, compared with viii. a, 5 1); Τ. Sextius XIII (viii a,
5 r; 11,5 r); Cicero and Sulpicius had XIV and VI (viii. 90, 5 8,
compared with viii. 4, 5 3) ; Caesar himself had XII: it follows by
the method of residuos that C. Caninius Rebilus had X Hence
Caesada statement in vii. 90 may be filled out thus ε- ’
