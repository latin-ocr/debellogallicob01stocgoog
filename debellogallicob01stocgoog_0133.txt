Ι contributed to strength. Even the protection afforded by clothes

was sometimes dispensed with, and the Gaul, who habitually

Romans. It is to the neglect ol this source of sasety at a later
period by the Romans themselves that Vegetius ascribes the

ἶ reverses they suffered at the hands of the barbatiane. The chief
’ aim ol their helmets seems to have been to increase the terrors

ol the wearer' s appearance by their height, like the bearsltins of

and birds (D. S. v. 30, ξ α).

meet with these combats more than once in the pages of
the Roman historiam, hut they have forgotten to record the
occasions on which the Gaul was victorious.
