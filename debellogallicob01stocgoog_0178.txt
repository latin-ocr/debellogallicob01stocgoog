ments the conclusion come to by Tacitus coincides with that of ἵ

Caesar.

Strabo does not commit himself to ethnological speculation 3
at all: buthe gives us a description of the physical appearance i
of the Britons founded on some slight personal observation. l
They were, he says, taller than the Gauls and not so red-haired, ’

but less compact in their bodies. As a proof of their height
he mentions that he had seen some boys, or rather hobbledeboys,
from Britain in Rome, who stood six inches above the tallest
people there ; but they were bandy-legged and ill-built generally
(Str. iv. 5, § a, p. aco).

The conclusion reached by Caesar, that some of the inhabi-
tants of Britain had come within comparatively recent times
from Belgium, which means with him only the opposite coast
of France, whereas others were there before them, is quite
in accordance with the results of modern philology. A glauce
at Professor Rhys's coloured map of the distribution of peoples
in Britain¹ shows the Brythonic branch of the Celtic race, to
whom the Gauls belonged, occupying all the more fertile parts
of the island, as the Saxone do now, while their Goidelic
brethren are pushed into the cornere. Quite in the north
there is a tract marked as occupied by a non-bryan race,
traces of whom are also to be found spattered over the Goidelic
districts. To this dispossessed non-Aryan racc the Professor
boldly ascribes the origin of Druidism.

e· ' . Having already spoken of the Celtic religion in connexion

with Gaul, we need not enlarge upon the subJect here. lt is
likely that amid the gloom of our island, where it is believed
to have originated (2 13, ξ rr), it would assume its most
sombre and awful form. We hear of altars stained with
human blood and of divination through the quivering entrails
ofa human victim². As for magic, Britain, according to Pliny,
might have taught Persia (N. H. xxx. § 13). That author also
