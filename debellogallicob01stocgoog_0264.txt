thus wholly in the country of the Allobroges, but there was even
then a bridge connecting it with that of the Helvetii. This bridge

it was Caesar's first care to break down. ln auswer to a nequest
from the Helvetii that they might pass peaoeably through the
Roman province Caesar replied that he would taire time to con·
sider the matter. ‘Come back to me,' he said, ‘on the ides of
April! Meantime with the one legion which was then in Further
Gaul and recruits which he had levied on his arrival he contrived
by availing himself of natural advantages to render the south
bank of the thne impregnable over the nineteen Roman miles
which is the distance in a straight line between Genera and
the present Fort de l’flcluse, or rather the Montagne du Vuache,

no natural obstacles to their progress on that side like that which
we have seen offered by the thne

Accordingly leaving his chief lieutenant Labienus to guard the
river, Caesar returned with all speed into Italy, tbat is, into
Cisalpine Gaul, levied two legions there, summoned out three
others that were wintering iu the neighbourhood of Aquileia, and
