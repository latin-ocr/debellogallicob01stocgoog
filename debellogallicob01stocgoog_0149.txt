the sea which separated them from the mainiand, though the
distance was greater than that to Britain. These last words
are quite out of keeping with the view which would identisy the
cassiterides with the islands about the Bay oi Vigo ¹.

What then are we to do when dislodged equally from either
hypothesis as to the whereabouts oi these mysterious islandsi
It seems that we must fall bach upon the position oi Herodotus
who did not know that there were any Cassiteridas. The
Cassiterides in fact were originally only a name whereby the
Greeks sought to satisiy their craving to know whence the
Carthaginians got their tin As the trade was conducted from
Gadeira, they were naturally associated with Spain: but the
coast oi Spain is very bare of islauds, and it was difficult to
accommodate them there. Hence Strabo sends them out to sea,
and modern geographers have until lately relegated them to the
Sdlly lsles. Like the island oi Delos before it was chained, the

without. In either case we should hare heard of the matter.
