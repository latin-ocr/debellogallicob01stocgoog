In addition to the forces which have been enumerated as Troop·
serving under Caesar himself, there were twenty-two cohorts Qum·

against the Romans and the Province itseli was invaded

From the constituent parts oi the army we now turn to itstr)1u offi-
personalty‚ and must say something about its officers and other Quidue
functionaries. ’ omenes

When the officers have to be spoken oi collectively‚ as opposed The
to the men, they are called hy the vague name ‘duces' ; but iu [mmor.
a special sense there -was only one ‘dua' and that was the ·
‘imperator‚' who had the auspices. Caesar speaks of Marius

’ (i. 40, 5 5) aud also oi himself (ii. 25,·§ 3) as ‘imperator' It
