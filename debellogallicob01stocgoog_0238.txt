It seems to have been an innovation of Ceesar's to assign
the charge of a particular legion to a particular ‘legatus’; bnt
this practice vvas hept up under the Empire.

The The tribunes (⁸ tribuni militum ')‚ according to Varro (Ι. L. v.
m § 81), contain in their name a reference to the primitive division
into three tribes and the original army of three thousand This
vievr is at all events supported by their Greek name χιλίαρχοι
(Polyb. vi. 19,§ r: Acts xxi. 31), and is in heeping with the title
‘tribunus Celernm’ as that oitbe original master of the horse ¹.

In the Roman army as described by Polybius the tribunes
formed the nucleus ol the legions. Alter the consuls had been
appointed, sourteen tribunes vvere chosen hom among men who
had served five yearly campaigns, and then ten more from
men who had served ten campaigns. As tltere vvere four
legions, this gives six tribunes to each legion. When
the manhood oi Rome vvere assembled on the Capitol, the
iourteen younger tribunes distributed themselves thus-ionr ior
the first legion, three ior the second, four lor the third. three
tor the fourth ; then the ten elder ones joined them as follows—
tvo sor the first legion, three lor the second, tvro lor the third,
three for the fourth. After this the tribunes proceeded to pielr
