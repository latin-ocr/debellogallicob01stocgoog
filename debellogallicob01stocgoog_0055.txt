of tlte Bellum Africanum speaks of the special favour of the
Gods towards Caesar (74, 5 3), and mentions divine service
after the battle ol Thapsus (86, § 4). But though Caesar was
willing to be helped by religion, he was very unwilling to be
tbwarted by it. Like Claudius in the first Punic War and
Flaminius in the second, he was not the man to be deterred by
omens (Suet. J. C. 59, 77, 81), but, unlike those commandere,

Aa Caesar claimed to be descended from the Gods, he is hardly

In his laudatiori on his aunt Julia, delivered in his quaestorship
(Suet J. C. 6), after pointing out that his family were descended

there is one thing in which he believed proloundly‚ and that is- {m}
himself. He was certainly gifted with more than his due share

of that ‘absurd presumptor in their own good fornme‚’ ol
which Adam Smith speaks as characteristic of the greater part
