had sounded the signal sor retreat, he says that the trumpet was
not heard by the soldiers. These passages are in exact agree·
ment with the words of Vegetius (ii ιι), ‘Tubicen ad bellum
vocat milites et rursum receptui canit! The signal for battle,
according to the same author, was given by a blare ol trumpets
and horns ¹. The ‘bucina’ was specially employed sor marking
the watches of the night, so that the word itsell was used inter·
changeably with ‘vigilia ¹. The ‘classicum' vegetius tells us
was sounded by the ‘bucinatores' on the hom. lt was dis-
tinctive os the ‘imperator.' Hence the significance of Pompeius
allowing it to be sounded by his father-in·law Scipio, when he
joined him before Pharsalia ³.

The engineers (‘sabri') come into view as early as the Fugineem
Servian organisation os the army. Under Caesar they had
plenty os work to do, but they did not form a separate body,
sor we find him speaking (v. rr, ξ ι) ol picking thein out from
the legions and sending to the Continent sor others, when the
ticet had to be repaired in Britain. Care was taken in the levy
to select a certain number oi men who were skilled artificers
(Veget i. 7; it 11). Still there was a special officer‚ called
‘praelectus labrum,’ oi whom we lind mention not infrequently⁴.
The historiari Velleius Paterculus tells us that his grandfather
C. Velleius served in this capacity under Pompeius, Brutus, and
Tiberius Nero. Caesar, botb in his praetorship and consulship,
recommended Balbus sor the lilte post (Cic. Balb. § 63), which
shows that it was a government appointment. Ι
