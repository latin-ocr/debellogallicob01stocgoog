12 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

Caesar might have lied with comparative impunity, had he
been so minded; in the former he could not, and we infer that
he did not, since no single statement in the Civil War' has
been controverted by his countrymen, the only demurrer that
has reached us being this vague growl oi Pollio's‚ which is
unsubstantiated by details.

Caesar’s There is one point, however, which we must concede to our

bad certainly not fallen under bis own observation But a charge
like this is not special to Caesar, but common to the writers of
antiquity, and tells with tenfold lorce against others. In those
days the world was young, and either Nature was more erratic
then than now or her course had not been so definitely ascer-
tained. Within the range ol their immediate experienee men
looked for unilonnity: beyond that everything was possible.
There is something of the same spirit lelt among ourselves. No
one expects Mahatmas in Cbeapside, but we are willing to
accept them in Thibet.

tttsgeneral On the whole then our review of the writers as nearly

&ffb-m contemporaneous to Caesar as possible tends only to strengthen
our confidence in his statements. He had the veracity which
Aristotle tells us is characteristic ol theman of great soul.
We may leel pretty sure that the way of truth for us lies in
squating our theories with Caesar’s statements, not in the
converse process.

‘Therme Why did Caesar call his work ‘Commentarios'? The word

tffflffl' is not one that quite carries its meaning on the surlace,
especially alter it has been overlaid with associatione foreign
to its primary sense. lt is employed both in the masculine
and in the neuter gender. In the one case we may supply

volumen, in the other liber, as Aulus Gellius does lor us ¹.
