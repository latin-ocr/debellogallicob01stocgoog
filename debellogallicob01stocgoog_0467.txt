DE BELLO GALLICO. LIB. VI ²⁰3

say where, bct we may assume that it was at his headquarters of
Samarobriva-and, finding that the Senones, Carnutes, and Treveri
did not attend, considered this to be equivalent to a declaration of
war. He therefore brolre up the council and ordered it to meet
again at Paris, which was a convenient point for operating minet
the Senones (Sena). The rapidity ol bis movements induced both
this tribe and their neighbours the Carnutes (Chartrer) to sue for
mercy through the Aedui and Remi. Caesar, anxious not to be
detained, granted it for the time. Then he held the council and
ordered cavalry from the states.

Caesar was now free to devote his enantion entirely to tbe
scheme of vengeance he meditated. There was no chance of
Ambiorix meeting him in the field: the question was how to catch
him. The country to the west ol his was in Caesare hands, but
he might escape northwards into the territory of the Menapii,
a land of woods and marshes, whose inhabitante had never sent
ambassadcrs to Caesar, or eaawards to the Germam across tbe
Rhine, with whom the fugitive chieftain had entered into friendly
relations through the Treveri. Both these contingencies bad to be ·
guarded against. For operatione in these directions Amisos was
no longer suitable as a base. Caesar therefore mansferred the
baggage of the whole army to the camp of Labienus in or near
the country cfthe Treveri (cp. v. 24, t 23 53,§ 1: v'n ς, § 63
7,§ 1), sending with it two legions. lie himself with five lightly
equipped legions marched against the Menapii, and, having entered
their country in three divisione, made such havoc of it as to cause
them to ask lor terius, which were granted on the express condition
that they would not harbour Ambiorix.

Meanwhile Labienus had been as energetic and successful as
Caesar. The Treveri had been on the point of attacking his single
legion with large forces both cf horse and font, when they learnt
that it had been reinforced by two others. This news made thern
at first desirous of waiting for the Germane, whose aid they were
expecting. Rut the wily lieutenant was able, as usual, by working
upon their aelf-conlidence, to draw them into a disastrous engage-
ment, which was followed by tbe surrender of tbe state, so that
when their allies arrived, there was nothing for them to dc but to ·
go home again. The kinemen of Indutiomarus went with thena
and the government was handed over to Cingetorix.
