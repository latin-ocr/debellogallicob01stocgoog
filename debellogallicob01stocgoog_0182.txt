150 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

follows that this was the Thule oi Pydreas or Tyle of Pliny,
which is spoken ol as within a day’s sall os the Frozen Sea
Between Ireland and Britain Pliny interposes not only Mona,
but Menapia, Riginia, Vectis, Silumnus, and Andros. His
Mona may perhaps be Anglesey, like that ol Tacitus, and
his Monapia Caesar's Mona or the Isle of Man. With regard
to Vectis his mistake is plain That is the Isle ol Wight
(otherio), which Ptolemy (ii. 3, ξ 33) tells us lies under the
Great Harbour. This must not be confused with the island
ol Ictis already spoken ol. Below Britain, says Pliny, lie
Sambis and Axanthos. The last is no doubt the same as

mantis ‘or Ushant ¹. Pliny gives a wide range to the British
Isles‚ as he goes on to mention the Glaesiae or Electrides,
which are the amber islands ln the German Ocean. His
statement that none of these lesser islands exceeds 125 miles
in circumference is true, except ol Lewis and Harris, the

largest of the Hebrides.
