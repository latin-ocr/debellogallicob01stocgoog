eighty years, aud there was no instance of any one having
thrown it on his land twice in a lifetime (N.H. xvii. ἐξ 42, 45).
With regard to the political institutions of the Britons, we
on. have very little information. Diodorus Siculus speaks of their
being under hings and potentates ¹. Caesar talks of kings, of
whom there were four in Kent alone (v. aa,§ 1),and of pnit-
ciper. Strabo speaks only of δυναστεῖαι. Tacitus, vvn'ting of
Agricola's time, says that formerly the Britons obeyed kings,
but that then they were under prtitcr'pes and torn by factiuns,
noticing the same inability to combine which we have already
found to mark the Gauls. Dio Cassius at a still later date says
of the Caledonii and Maeatae that their government was mostly
democratical. Even in Caesada time the people counted for
something, so far at all events as to serve as an excuse for
a measure which the chiefs desired to repudiate (iv. 27, ς 4).

(iii. 9, ξ ro ς iv. ao, i r), it has been inferred that they must
have had ships like the Veneti: beyond this there is no evidence
for it. The only vessels that we hear of in connexion with thern
are the coracles, which were mere wicker-work covered with
leather. In these, according to the historian Timaeus, who san
only be following Pytheas, they would take a six days' voyage
to the island of Mictis, whence the tin carue (Plin. N. H. iv.

'§1o4; vii.§ 206). These boats, says Pliny, ‘are made even

now in the British Ocean ¹.'
Consuesse. Such trade as there was in Britain during Caesar's time was
carried on by the Veneti (iii. 8, § r). Strabo (iv. 4,§ ι) tells us
