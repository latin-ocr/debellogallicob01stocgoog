Britain and Rome, in which the savage lady by no means came
off worst in the argument (Ι). C. lxxvi 16).

i· A charge of cannibalisrn has even been brought against some

a father oi the Church. St. Jerome says in one os his writings,
‘But why should I spealt ol other nations when 1 mysels as
a young man in Gaul have seen the Atticoti, a British tribe,

ot' a given country was—Were they indigenous? The problem
is not one lilrely to meet with a satisfactory solution, but itis
not intrinsically absurd. For, unless we hold with the Peripa·
tetics that the human racc has existed lor ever, man must have
originated sometime somewhete. And, if so, why not in one
place as well as another? Caesar's answer to the question
with regard to Britain is that some oi its inhabitants were
indigenous, and others not. Under the latter head he puts
the inhabitants of the sea-board, of whom he says that they
came from Belgium. He finds a confirmation os this statement
