222 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

wespon θυρεός, possibly from its ahane, but more probably irom
its material ¹.

Oi gresves (¹ ocreae ') there is no mention in Caesar. From
Vegetius (i. ao) we gather that they were worn by the common
soldiers only on the right ahin. This points to the lact that
it was the right leg which was adwanced in combat¹.

The soldier’s hob-nailed boots (‘ caligae ') have been already
alluded to. It was from these that the emperor Gaius got his
sobriquet of Caligula, when, asa child, he was the soldiers’
pet in Germany.

’ · As a protection from the weather the soldier wore a thick

woollen cloak called ‘sagium' which ended in a fringe
(‘ fimbria,' Varr. L. L. v. ς 79). This may have been originally
horrowed from the Gauls (v. 42, Μ), but it becarm as dis·
tinctive oi the Romans in war as the ‘toga' was in peace.
When a ‘tumultus' was declared‚ it was worn even by those
who were not actually in the field ⁸. We see lrom a passage
in the Civil War (i. 7 5, § 3) that it could be used in emergencies
as a promerion, wrapped round the left arrn, in place of a shield.

The two offensive weapons carried by the legionary were the
javelin (¹ pilum ’) and the sword (‘ gladius h. The former was
a missile weapon used to discompose the ranhs os the enemy
before the deadly attach at close quarters took place3 iitirne
were pressing, it might be dispensed with. lt was thus like
a round oi musketry preluding a charge with the bayonet⁴.

The ‘pilum,' which was a distinctively Italian weapon, was
much heavier than the ‘hasta' several of which were carried by
a single light-armed combatantl. It was called by the Greeks
