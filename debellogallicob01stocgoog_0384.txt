122 C. IULII CAESARIS

He rejoined his army earlier than his wont‚ but found that the
Germans were already extending their incursions into the terri-
tories of the Eburones and of the Condrusi, who were vassalo of
the Treveri. Without hesitation he marched against thern. While
he was still a few days off he was met by an embassy. Caesar
refused all terma with the Germana so long as they remained on
Gallie soil, but offered to provide thern with land in the territory of
the Ubii, whose envoys had come to ask his aid against the Suebi.
The ambassadors promised to report his proposal to their country·
