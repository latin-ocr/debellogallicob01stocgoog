potentates in Britain, and that ior the most part they lived at
peace with oue another. Strabo, in speaking ol the manners oi
tbe Britons, says that they were partly like those oi the Gauls,
partly simpler and more barbarous3 among some there was no
chesn, gardening, or husbandry.

We must therefore not regard the inhabitants ol our islands
in Caesar’s time as a homogeneous people, hut must recognise
varying degrees of civilisation or satagery among tribes, who ,
must have differed to some extent in language, and may even
have differed in race. But that none oi thern oould have mmuh
attaimd to a very high level is best shown by what Caesar says ‘tonna'
about their ‘towns' (r. ar, § 3), which were mere forest last-
nesses. This is confirmed also by Strabo (iv. 5, ξ a, p. aoo),
who says, ‘Now their towns are the woods3 lor having lelled
trees and lenced round a broad circular space, they construet huts
lor themselves there and stall their cattle, hut not lor a long time!
The last words of Strabo might seem to point to a nomad life,
hut we get the clue to their interpretation from Caesar, who tells
us that these ‘towns' were intended as refugas against attach.

But though the Britons had no towns in our sense ol the Buttdtnga
word, or rather because they hed no towns, the country was
doued over with buildings, for the population ia described as
very thick ¹. These buildings are said by Caesar to have
been very lilre those oi the Gauls. Diodorus Siculus, probably
iohofing Pytheas, speaks os them slightingly as poverty·
· strichen structuras, chiefly os reed or wood.
That the tribes with whom Caesar himself came into contact agrien-

were agricultural is plain from the fact that he ravaged their tm·

dorus, which consisted in storing away the grain ears and all.
By the time ol Pliny, British agriculture was able to supply
