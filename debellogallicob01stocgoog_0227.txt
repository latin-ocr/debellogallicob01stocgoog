this legion as taking part in both the expeditione to Britain
(iv. 32, 51;v. 9, 5 *1);itwas afterwards with Labienus at
Paris (vii. ⁶2, 5 3). The Xllth legion under Servius Galba was
exposed to great danger in attempting to pass the winter of
nc 56-7 near MartIgny (iii. 1, 5 1); it too was at Paris with
Labienus.

At the time of the second expedition to Britain the number
of Caesar’s legions is still eight. There were three leit with
Labienus, while five accompanied Caesar himself to Britain
(v. 8. 5 ι). ln the unquiet winter which followed (nc. 54-3)
there were apparently eight and shall legions quartered about
the country (v. 24), hut we may fairly infer that the five extra
4 cohorts intrusted to Sabinus and Cotta were contingente drawn
ἵ from the rest of the army and were meant to impart suength to

f the legion of tiros which was being sent into the country of the
¹ Eburones (v. 24, 5 4). These fifteen cohorte were lost at

Adustum, but in place of them thirty cohorte, or three new
legions, were brought into Gaul (vi. 1, 5 4). The entire legion
which perished must have been XIV, for in r. 24, 54 Caesar
speaks of it as one of those which he had most recently Ievied
beyond the Padus. It is only XIII and XIV which answer
to this description, and we lrnow that XIII passed the winter
saiely among the Esuvii under the command of Lucius Roscius
(v. 53, 5 6). Of the three new legions one took the place and
number of the lost XIVth (vi. 32, 553 viii. 4,5 3), whose ill·
fortune it inherited, for two of its cohorts were destroyed at
the same camp of Aduatuca by the unexpected incursion of
the Sugambri (vi. 37, 5 8; 44, 5 ι); another was tbe Ist, lent
by Pompeius (viii. 54, 5 ²3 C. iii. 88, 5 1; Lucan vii. 218),
but which had been raised in Caesar’s own province of CisalpIne
Gaul (vi. 1, 5 ις viii. 54, 5 a) ς the third we must suppose
to have been the XVth. The two legions last mentioned,
1 and XV, were those that were sent by Caesar, in accordanoe
with the decree of the Senate, as though to the Parthian war.
They formed the left wlng under Pompeius blmself at the battle
