and Isidorus made the circumference oi the island to be 4,87 5
miles (N. H. iv. roa).

Ii a line be drawn from point to point along our coesto,
without following the indentations, the south is found to give
330 English miles ¹, the east 596, the west 6⁶8, and the north
74, which gives a total oi r,⁶68 miles sor the circumference.

Caesar, regarding the island as a triangle, recognises awest
coast, which he puts at τοο miles: but what we regard as the
east coast was to him the north coast, with the exception oi
the comer which ‘loolrs towards Germany’ (v. 13, § 6). This
north comt he says is considered to be 800 miles long. If an
island has three sides, oi which one iaces north and the other
west, it follows that the third must run irorn the north to the
west, and this was apparently Caesar’s opinion with regard to
the trend oi the coast from Kent to the Land's End. He does
not say that the whole oi the side which was opposite Gaul
looked south, but only the lower corner of Kent(v.13,§r).
This third side he reckons at about 500 miles, which brings
the circumference oi the island up to a,ooo miles, an estimate
which is less than the trutlr, ii we iollow all the bendings ol
the coast, but more than what is got by measuring irorn one
prominent point to another.

Although Diodorus Siculus wrote aiter Caesar, he seems to
have preferred the authority oi the Greek mathematician to that
oi the Roman general. As his statement os the length ol
Britain coincides with that oi Pytheas, it seems sair to infer that
his other measurements are derived from the same source.
According to him the shortest side, which stretches along
Europe, is 7,5oo stades, the side which reaches from the strait
to the apex of the triangle 15,ooo, and the third side ao,000, so
that the whole circumference amounts to 4a,5oo stades, or
53¹²} Roman miles. This accords with what Strabo says as
to Pytheas making the circumference ‘more than 4ο,οοο stades,’
