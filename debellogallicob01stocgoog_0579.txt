high road from Paris to Perpignan. The spot is near the present
railway station ot ta CendreOrget. The Emperor has registered
his opinion on a stone with the inscription-

‘Camp occnpd par Jnles Cdsar
l'an ⁵² avant J. C.'

The exact dimensions oi the camp even are indicated by arrows
on the two convergent sides ot' the stone marked 467 metres and
646·2om. respectively. According to the same authority the hill
which Caesar captured (36, ξ 5), and where he established his
smaller camp, was La Roche Blancbe, which lies nearly due south
ol Gergovia. ·

But against this view there are certain objections that may be
urged.

ln the first place, as Caesar approached Gergovia from the north,
marching up the bank ot the Allier (34, ξ 2), it is perhaps natural
to suppose that he attached the town horn that quarten unless
we are told something to the contrary. ln the next place Caesar
tells us that the hill be captured was ‘e regione oppidi’ (36, § 5).
Now as a straight line can be drawn from any one point to any
other, this description could not be employed intelligibly by Caesar
except in refereme to some third point, which would presumably
be his own camp. We are therefore led to inser that the hill
captured lay in a straight line between Caesar's camp and the
town. Napoleon’s plan however makes the small camp form the
apex oi a triangle with a line between the oppidum and the large
camp lor its base. Agant, Caesar speaks of the hill in question
as being ‘egregie munitus. atque er omni parte cimumcisus,'a
description which is not applicable to La Roche Blanche; for,
though on the south side, where it overhangs the village, it is
extremely precipitous, yet on the north side it presents an easy
dope. F urther‚ it Caesar stood on La Roche blanche, he could
see lor himself any operations that were taking place on the
‘dorsum silvestre et angustum‚' whereas it is evident from the
account in 44 that he could not discern these from the smaller
