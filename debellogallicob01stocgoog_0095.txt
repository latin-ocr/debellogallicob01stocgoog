WARS WITH THE GAULS 63

Strabo (xii. 5, § ι) gives us some account of the internal orgariu-
organiaation of the Galatians, or Gallo· -graeci, as they were ‘¹⁰¹¹ ²¹¹⁶
called from their intermixture with the Greeks. Each of theg alent olthe
three tribes was divided into four tetrarchies These twelve ΟΜΝ
tetrarchias had each their several tetrarch, as well as a judge
and a general subject to the tetrarch ,· while under each general

there were two lienteriam-generals. The twelve tetrarchs had
aoouncil of three hundred, whose place of meeting was called
Drynaemetum. Cases of murder were tried by this council, all
others by the tetrarcha and the judges. This ancient constitution
gave way in Strabo's own time to the sway of three rulers, then
of two, and lastly ofa single king, Deiotarus, upon whose death
Galatia became part of the dominions of Amyntas, and eventually
along with the rest ol those dominions a Roman province. The
Galatiam were underthisfrnal form of govemment when St. Paul
addressed his epistle to them. The Celtic tongue was still to be
heard in Asia Minor at the end of the fourth century. St. Ῑιιιοιιιιιι
in the prologus to his Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians
says that in addition to Greelr, which was used universally in the
urst, the Galatians had a language of their own, which was like
that of the Treviri, though perhaps a little corrupted ¹.

We have seen that the Boii submitted to the Romans in 191 s..c cn. Μιιι-
ln the following year L. Scipio Asiaticus, who was then engaged {affl
in war with Antiochus, repulsed an attach from Galatian cavalrymt Gautr ιιι
on the hanlcs ol the Phrygius3 and ιιι the pitched battle ιιιΑειίι
which he defeated Antiochus, the same troops were employed
against him (Liv. xxxvii. 38, 40). This served as a pretext
(Lis. xxxviii. ra ; Flor. i. ιγ) to the consul of the next year

(ac. 189), Cn. Manlius Vulso, who was anxious for glory, for
an attaclr upon the Galatians. He marched his army frorn
Ephesus to Abbassus, where he halted for a time, as he was
