men in aiding the Eburones, and to beg that their territorias might
therefore be spared. The nequest was granted on condition that
they delivered up all Eburonian fugitives

The work of revenge was now to hegin. As his headquarters in
the scheme of devastation he meditated Caesar chose Aduatuca,
the very place where Sabinus and Cotta had pitched their ill-fated
camp the year before. The omens, it might be thought, were
against this selection, but Caesar had his reasons. Adustum was
a stronghold, it was a central point in the territory of the Eburones,
and the Roman works of the previous year could still be utilised
for defense. All the baggage of the army was deposited here, and
Quintus Cicero was leli in charge of it with the fourteenth legion,
one of those levied at the beginning of the year, and noo cavalry.
The nine remaining legions were divided equally between Caesar ·
himself, labienus, and Trebonius. Of these Labienus went north-
west in the direction of the Menapii, Trebonius south-west in that
of the Aduatuci, while Caesar himself went due west towards the
Esoeut or Schelde. The understanding was that they were all to
return to Aduatuca within six days frorn the time of starting.
Caesar's desire to injure the enemy was tempered by care for his

illustrated the chancer of war, and served to rob Quintus Cioero of
some of the laureis which he had von by his previous energy.

day since the departure of Cacsar, and this was also the day ort
which a fresh supply of corn ought to be served out to the soldiern
who rernained on garrison duty. There were tempting corn-lande
in the vicinity‚ separated from the camp only by a single hill.
Cicero, who up to now had carefully lrept his men within camp, at
length yielded to their clamours, and allowed half his legion of
‘raw reoruits to go out to forage. They were accompanied by
a large body of camp-followers and by some 300 veterane, who had
been left in garrison as invalida but had recovered within the
last few days. Now it so happened that a,ooo horsemen of the
