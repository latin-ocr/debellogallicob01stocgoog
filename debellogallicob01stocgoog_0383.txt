LIBER QUARTUS

EC. 65

SUMMARY.

Tne fourth book contains three episodes-the war with the
Usipetes and Tencteri, the first passage oi the Rhine and the first
invasion oi Britain, besides some operatione against the Morini
and Menapii.

The Usipetes and Tencteri were two German tribes which
suffered like others from the overwhelming power ol the vast
confederation ol the Suebi. Dislodged from their own abodes,
they wandered lor three years in many pairs oi Germany, and at
last came to the Rhineâ€š not far from where it flows into the sea.
The Menapii dwelt in these parts and had possessione on both
sides os the river. They retired before the invaders to the leit
bank, which they were able to hold against them. Despairing of
accomplishing their passage by force, the Usipetes and Tencteri
had recourse to fraud. They retired a three days' joumey from
the Rhine, and when the Menapii had msumed their possessione
on the right bank, they sent their cavalry back by night, who
surprised the Menapii, and possessed themselves os their vessels.
After this the whole body ol invaders established themselves on the
Gallie side os the river.

llere was a new complication ior Caesar, who was vell awere
that the Gauls would be likely to intrigue with the new-coniers.
