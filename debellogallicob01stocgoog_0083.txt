he was elected consul in his absence for the year 215. The

¹ Gauls knowing that he was about to pass through a vast wood,
the Silva Litana, had cut the trees on both sides of the way, so
as just to leave them standing. Then when the army, which
mounted to 25,ooo men, including allies, had entered the
wood, the lurlring barbariam—so at least the story runs-gave
apush to the outermost trees, which, communicating the impulse
to the rest, brought destruction on man and beast. The Gauls
then rushed in and despatched the stuvivors, so that scarcely
ten men escaped. Postumius himself fell fighting desperately.
His skuli was chased with gold and deposited in the most holy

This' rs the last that we hear of independent action on the Censes οι

Hannibal. Their quiescence may be accounted for by two the Geuls

testing as mercenaries under the Carthaginiens3 secondly, that Hanntbsl
those who remained at home were overawed by the force which
uas hept in their country by the Romans. During all the long
and desperate struggle with Hannibal the Roman grip on Gaul
was never relaxed. A standing force of two Roman legions
aud a large body of allies was kept up in the country, and year
byyear a praetor was sent to Ariminum, which was the Roman
basis of operatione against Gaul (Liv. xxviii. 38, 5 13)

Meanwhile it was not only' m Italy that the Romans found ceu ις
