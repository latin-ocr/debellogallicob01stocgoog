CHARACTER OF CAESAR 21

his treatment of the Mandubii. Expelled from their own city
of Alesia by its Gallie defendam, those unfortunate non—oom-
batants came to the Roman lines with their wives and children,
and begged to be taken as slaves, if only they might be fed.
But Caesar set guarda and forbade them to be received (vii. 78.
§53-5) He could not be expected to helphis enemies when
