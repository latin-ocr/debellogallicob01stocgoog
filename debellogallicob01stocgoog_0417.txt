C. IULIl CAESARIS

DE BELLO GALLICO

LIBER QUINTUS

lte. 54

SUMMARY.

Trrn fifth hook contains three striking episodes-the second
expedition to Britain, the affair oi Sabinus and Cotta, and the
desence ol his camp by Q. Cicero. Resides these there ere some
minor incidente. During the winter ol 55-54 Caesare soldiers
were husily employed in building ships made according to special
instructions from himself. There is a cnrious parallel between
the emit designed by Caesar and those oonstrueted by order ol the
Emperor Napoleon 1, when he contemplated invading Englend
from the same port ol Boulogne Napoleonâ€™s ships like Caesar's
were lint-bottomed, so ns to strand without breaking, end were
made to go with oars

Meantime Caesar was administrating his other provinces oi
Cisalpine Gaul end Illyricum, holding assires in both end quelling
an incipient attaclr ol the Pirustae upon the latter. On his retum
to Further Gaul he was well pleesed to find ehout 600 vessels oi
the pattem he had ordered as well ss twentyeight ships ol war
