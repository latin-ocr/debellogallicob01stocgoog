adaptation possessed by the Romans was nowhere more con·
spicuous than in military matters. ‘Fas est et ab hoste doceri'

is a motto on which they were prompt to act. Polybius notioed
this feature in their character, and tells bis readers of the

, quickness with which they adopted the Greek cavalry amour.

Sallust, speaking through the person oi Caesar (Cat. 51, § 38),
tells us that the annour oi the Romans, both ior offence and
defence, was borrowed hom the Samnites, as most of ‘the

stranded galley oi their own; and finally they battered down
the Greek cities with the siege apparatus and the engineering

was not new in the annals oi Roman warlare, as we shall see
later. The ‘scutum' oi the Roman legionary was adopted
from the Samnites, the ‘ gaesum' which the light-armed carried
at an early period (Liv. viii. 8, § 5) irom the Gauls'3 the short
sword, which became so distinctive of the Romaus,is said to
