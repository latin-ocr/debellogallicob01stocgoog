the fifth contahrs what he has to tell us about Britain and Ireland ;
in the first two chapters of the seventh hook he treats of Germany
and its inhabitants.

The value os Strabo is both direct and indirect. Bom himself
at Amasin in Pontus (xii. 3, ξ 39, p. 561) he had extended his
trarels westward to Etruria, and southward to the borders of
Ethiopia (ii. p. ιη). Bu't no man in those days could hope to
see the whole world for himself, and the best geographer was
he vho could make the best use of the materials supplied him
by others. Just as the several senses give their report of
a certain figure, colom, siae, aureli, feel and taste, while the
mind oombines them into the notion of an appla, so the intellect
of men of leaming-it is Strabo's own illustration-employing
the senses of individual observem, had to piece out a notion of
the world as a whole. Accordingly Strabo travelled in books
even more than in countries. In his account of Transalpine
Gaul he makes use of Caesar, of Aristode and Posidonius, of
the historiam Ephorus, Timaeus, Polybius, Timagenes, and
Asinius Pollio, of the travellers Pytheas and Artemidorus, not
to mention quotations from Aeschylus and Euripides. Of these,
spart from Caesar, the authority upon whom he relied most is
Posidonius. That philosopher had himself visited Gaul and
studied the manners of the inhabitants. He died about s. c. 51.

After Strabo we have Pomponius Mela, who composed Mela.
abn'ef but lively sketch in three books of the geography of the
vorldas known in his day. He appears in one passage (iii. 6, i 49)
to be referring to the triumph oi Claudius over Britain (see Suet.
Claud 17) asan event which was just about to take place. If
thisbe so, it would fix the date of composition as mn. 44 ς but
his latest editor sees reason to suppose that the allusion is rather
to the fantastic lreaks of Caligula (Suet. Calig. 47). Pomponius
Mela is mentioned by Pliny among the authorities for the three
books of his great work which deal with geography.

From Pliny himself (n. n. 24-79) we gain very little informa· Pliny.
