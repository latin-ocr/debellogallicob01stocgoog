including Eporedorix, Viridomarus, aad his own brothers, had
been put to death by Caesar on a charge ot communicating with
the Arvernians. This assertion vas at once bdieved, and some
Roman citizens who vvere with the force were mnured to death, the
army having made up its mind to join Vercingetorix. Meantime
however Eporedorix, who was alive and well, had intormed Caesar
oi the design, and the energetic Proconsul vvas dorm upon thern
with tour legions and all his cavalry before they had adranced five
miles further. Litaviccus fied with his personal followers to
Gergovia, while the Aedui threw doun their arms and begged ior
mercy. Alter allowing his soldiers three honrs' rest at night,
Caesar began his march back. lle was met about halt-way by
messengers t'rom Fabius, vho had been lett in command, to tell
him that the camp had been attached in lotoe during his absence.
This news increased the alacrity ot the men, and these indomitable
mmpaigners arrived in camp before sunrise, having acoomplished
fifty Roman miles in little more than twenty-tour hours (325 33

Though Caesar had at once sent messengers to the Aedui to tell
thern how he had spared their men, yet the lie spread by Litaviccus
had already done its worlc The property of Roman citizens had
been plundered and themselves enslaved or even killed A military
tribune, M. Aristius, had been brought out under a saie-conduct

from Cabillonum (chalon-sur-Smne) along with the Roman mer·
chants in the town, aad then attached on the vray. The party

defended themselves with vigour and vere under siege night and
day, when a sudden change was caused in the demeanour nithe
Aedui hythe news that their men were in Caesar¹s power. The
state now toolr every means to exculpate itsell, bnt too many
persons vere implicated to allow of the public repentance being
sincere. Caesar was well avare that his ancient allies were leav-

ing him, aad his one anxiety now was to get away from Gergovia
and effect a junction with Labienus. Some appearance os success
against the enemy before he went would make his retreat look less
like a flight. An opportunity ior thia seemed now to present

millii paying a visit to the smaller camp Caesar was surprised to
observo that a hill which vas occupied by the enemy, though it
had been blaclr with men the day before, was almost bare novt.
