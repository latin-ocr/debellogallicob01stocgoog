regarded as simplya larger island belonging to the same group¹.
l Hence our historice of England are wont to begin with

’ would have surprised the ancient writers, from whom we
ζ suppose ourselves to have derived it. Diodorus Siculus
ζ (v. 38, ξ 4), after describing the Cassiterides as lying off the
³ coastof Spain, above the country of the Lusitani, goes on to
say that a great deal of tin was also brought from Britain to
Gaul, and thence conveyed by an overlaud route to Massilia
and Narbo. That Diodorus is here following Posidonius may
, be regarded as certain from the coincidence of his language and
of the sequence of thought with that of Strabo (iii. p. 147),
who is confesscdly doing so. According to Strabo in another
passage (iii. p. 175) the Cassiterides ar'e ten iu number, and lie
near oue another out to sea to the north of the harbour of the
Artabri. If hc says in another place (ii. p. rao) that they are
somewhere in the latitude of Britain, that is only part of the
general error which made him imagine the western parts of
Biitain to lie opposite the Pyrenees. Mela, himselfa Spaniard,

Pliny (iv. ς 119) follows suit in saying that the Cassiterides are
off Celtiberia ⁸. Lastly Ptolemy (ii. 6, ξ 76), treating them under
