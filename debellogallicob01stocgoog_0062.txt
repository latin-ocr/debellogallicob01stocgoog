Pompeius assented to a higher honour than had ever been

Now why were these uuparalleled honours heaped on Caesari
Partly no doubt because he was the popular idol, partly because
he had bribed pretty nearly ewerybody in one way or another,
but partly also because he was really considered to have done
a greater work than any one before him, and to be the greatest
general that Rome ever produced. The historiens of Rome,

millions oi men, of whom he slew one million, and took captive
another. Appian (iv. a) raises the number of men against whom
he fought to over four millions, and the number oi tribes to 400.
