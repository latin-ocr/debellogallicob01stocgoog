that all languages but their own were gibberish. It is hy
a mere accident that Caesar lets drop the information that
Ariovistus had to leam the Gallie tongue (vi 47, ξ 4); he does
not mention the difference of language in his professed contrast
between Gauls and Germana The strong opposition how·
ever, familiar to us, between Celt and Tanton, was wholly
unknown to the early Greek writers, to whom Germany was
part of Κελτική. Unsatisfactory as Caesar’s account of the
Germana is, it is yet daylight to darkness as compared with
the notions of his predecessore. We now becom avare for the
first time that the Germana were as much foreigners to the
Gauls as they were to the Romans themselves, that the invasion
η of the Cimbri and Teutoni, which had menaced Italy, had
brought untold calamity upon Gaul, and that Gaul was at that

time a political *Holland ever ready to be swamped by the
German ocean

It was not always so. For at an earlier epoch, Caesar Early
(vi. 24) informans, the tide of immigration had rolled eastward‚

and Gaul had been the invader, not the invaded. It was theninGer- .
that the Volcae Tectosages, whose home in Gaul was under the Μ’·
shadow of the Pyrenees, had established themselves in the most
fertile parts of Germany in the neighbourhood of the Hercynian
Forest Tacitus (G. aiil r), who quotes Caesar only in this
connexion, points to Helvetia as another instance of the
successful occupatiori of German soil by a Gallie tribe, and to

³ the establishment of the Boii iu Bohcmia before they were
dispossessed by Maroboduus and his Marcomanni ¹. ‘The name,'
says Tacitus (G. ²8, 5 a), ‘still attests the past history of the
district: as it does also to the present day, Bohcmia being
supposed to mean ‘the home of the Boii? This intermingling
of the two raccs may be one way of accounting for the puaaling
fact of the occurrence of Gallie names among the Germana.

Caesar himself (vi. 24, §5 4-6) accounts for the superiority in
