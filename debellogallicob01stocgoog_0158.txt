126 CAESAR’S ΒΑΗ-16 WAR

regards the breadth however Dio Cassius is pretty accurate,
making it at the greatest agro stades (ε 2882 Roman miles)
aud at the least 300 (= 37} Roman miles).

As regards the sbape os Britain the first idea was that it was

· ·' asoelene triangle. We have seen reason to believe that this

was the view ol Pytheas, and it was held by Caesar himself, by
Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Mela, of whom Diodorus and
Mela compared it to Sicily. Livy however, whose ro5th book
is a great loss in this connexion, thought that the shape ol
Britain would be better expressed by calling it a rhomboid, and
either be or a later writer named Fabius Rusticus lilrened it to
the blade ol a battle-axe, upon which Tacitus (Agr. ιο) remarks
that this leaves out ol sight the enormous wedge-lilre protuber-

ance added to the island by Caledonia. Tacitus does not tell
us in what direction this wedge projected‚ but perhaps he shared
in the mistaken idea afterwards held by Ptolemy, that Caledonia
bulged out to the east

The supposed situation ol Britain has already incidentally

been touched upon. We have seen how Strabo regarded the
sontb coast ol the island as lying all along the coast of Gaul
from the Rhine to the Pyrenees. He asserts that Kent is
visible from the mouth os the Rhine¹. The Pyrenees, the
Garonne, the Loire, the Seine, and the Rhine lay in his view
pretty nearly parallel in a direction lrom south to north ¹.
Hence the four passages which he tells us were habitually used
from Gaul to Britain, namely from the Rhine, the Seine, the
Loire, and the Garonne (iv. 5, ξ a, p. 199) are regarded by him
aa being about the same length. What he says of the length
of Caesar's passage in one place (ibid.) he extends to tbe rivers
of Gaul generally in another (iv. 3, ξ 4, p. 193). In spite os
Caesar's statement that the passage from Itium was 30 miles
