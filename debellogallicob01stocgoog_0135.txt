GAUL ¹⁰3

breed, but a quantity ot meat, roast, balted, or boiled. They
would taire the meat in both hands aad tear itoff the bones like
lions, or, itthe difficulty were too great-to be solved by nature’s
mechom, they would produce from their sides a knife, which
had its private sheath in the scebbard of the sword, and with
this cut the meat. Such oi them as dwclt near rivers or the sea
would have fish ior dinner, which they roasted and ate with salt,
vinegar, and cumin. They made no use of oil, which was
rare, and the taste ior which they had not acquired. At s dinner·
partytheguestswouldbe rangedinacircle,the man oigmatest
dignsty, whether from military distinction, birth, or wealth,
occupying the post of honour; next to him was the host; and
then the rest according to their rank. The henchmcn who
carried their shields stood behind them, while the squires feasted
in a similar circle opposite to their masters (Athen. iv. 36, p. 152).
Strabo (ir. 4, § 3) informs us that the Gauls used a great deal
of mrllr in their diet, and that their chief meat was porlr, either
fresh or salted. He describes the long-legged pigo, which ate
still to be seen in France‚ and remarks that they were aa dan·
gerous as wolves to suangers. Diodorus speaks of their being
waited upon by boys and girls at table, and says that they
honoured the brave in Homeric iashion with a bigger helping
(D. S. v. 28, i 4)

The honses ot the Gaulo were oi wood snd wicker-work. Honset
They were dome-sheped, large, and well thatched (Str. iv. 4, ξ 3).
Caesar tells ns (vi. 30, ὁ 3) that they were generally placed in
the neighbourhood of woods and rivers for the sake ol coolness,
which shows us that the summere must have been pretty hot
in Gaul.

We are accustomed to think oi France as a rich country in Mineral
the proper sense oi having an abundant supply of the means os mm
life and comfort. This it was also in antiquity, especially when
its resources had begun to be developed alter the Roman
conquest. But besides this, ancient Gaul seems to have been

a seritable El Dorado in its supply ol the precisus metals.
