This last garment was also worn by the Spaniards (App. vi. μ,
odfin). The Romans too assumed it, but only when there
was a eall to arms, whereas with the Gauls it was hanimatt
lt was the colours however which the Gaul indulged in that
startled the Greek and Roman observet, his staring stripes
and the brilliancy oi his checkered tartan3 his garments too,
iihe were oi superior rank, would be sometimes bespangled
with gold. This barbaric taste lor bedirenment displayed itsell
also in the wearing os golden ornaments by the men as wellas
hythe women. Nothing is more distinctive os the Gaul than
his‘torques' oi solid gold; and he would wear also bracelets and
armlets oi the same metal, as well as large rings, and in war

that in Gaul, and especially in Aquitania, you would never see

sashion we may suppose, which gave rise to the name Gallia
Comata. The effect of the wash used on the hair was to make
itas thick as horsehair. Some oi them shaved their chin, others
had moderate beards; the nobles wore no whislters‚ but grew
long monaches, which embanassed them at table.
