to pass—the hunter state, the nomed state, and the agricultural stete ot
state. ln which ol these were the Germane in the time ol mm·
Caesar? The answer seems to be that they were in all three. ⁸
When tbey were not engaged in war or brigandage, most oi
their time was spent in hunting (iv. 1, 5 ὃς vi. 21, 5 3). Their
sole ricbes even in the time oi Tacitus (G. 5, 5 a) consisted in
cattle, and Caesar (vi. 35, 5 6) himself has noticed their avidity

ior this living money. nt the same time they did raise crops,
though nothing bnt grain, and never in the same place two
years running (iu. r, 5 7; vi. aa, 5 a). Under pressure of
circumstances they were even more ready than the Boers ol
South Africa to ‘trek' off in their wagons, and seelr ‘fresh
woods and pastures new ¹.’ Situated as they were geographically
between the purely nomad Sarmatians (Mela iii. 5 343 Tac. G.

46, 5 a) and the comparatively settled inhabitants of Gaul, their
manner of lile also seems to have been intermediate between
that oi their neighbours on either side. This facility of migra·
tion is noted by Strabo as the great characteristic of the
Gennans, and it is entirely in keeping with what Caesar
(iv. r, 5 7; vi. sr‚5 2) says ol the absence from among them ol
any private property in land. The tribes indeed had territories‚
which they sought to secure from invasion by keeping as large
abelt as possible ol waste land about them ², but beyond this

the institution ol lauded property does not appear to have gone.
‘Every year,' says Caesar (vi. 22, 5 a), ‘the magistrates and
chiefs assign to families and clans os men, in a general assembly‚

as much land as they think lit, and where they think fit, and

ayear aiter compel them to pass on to sornewhere else ;' and
when he is speaking specially of tbe Suebi (iv. r, 5 7), on whom
no doubt his account oi the Germana generally is based, he
says, ‘nor is it lawsnl ior them to remain more than a year in
one spot, to iubebit it' Among other reasons which the
Germane are made by Caesar lvi. aa, 5 3) to assign sor this
