forced to fly with the loasof bis baggage. The general opposed
to him was Hirtuleius, one of Sertorius' officere, who had the
title of quaestor, for Sertorius imitated the forms of tbe Roman

eommonwealth Before the arrival of Pompeius tlte movement
under Sertorius had begun to effect Gaul (Liv. Epit xc; Plut

Sert. 12; Eutr.vi r.)
In the following year (n. c. 77) Pompeius crossed tbe Alps by

adiiferent route from that followed by Hannibal ¹. He had ’

to light his way through Gaul, but is able to boast in his
letter to the Senate that be hed recovered the Provinoe. On
his way be made a grant of conquered land to the Massilians ².
It was shortly ulter the arrival of Pompeius in Spain, and
while the wer with Sertorius was still going on, that M. Fonteius
was governor for three years in Gaul. Alter his retirement
from office he was prosecuted on charges of extortion by a
deputation of Gauls beaded by Indutiomarus, a chief of the
Allobroges. His cause was pleaded by Cicero, whose defence
amounts roughly to this—that the Gauls had been irritated by

tbe levies of troops and contributione of corn and money ,

demanded from them by Fonteius in the interests of the common·
wealth; that no oue could believe the word of the Gauls,
asacrilegious nation who had gone sofar out of their way to
sack Delphi and had laid siege even to Jupiter Capitolinus
We do not lrnow whether these arguments carried conviction
to the minds of the judges. The speech reveals to us the
Provincia as a country burdened with debt, a condition common

to Gaul generally (vi. 13,§ a), but swarming with Roman
men of business.

'Ibe murder of Sertorius in 72 end the subsequent
defeat and death of Perperna brought tbe war in Spain to
a close. On his way back to Italy Pompeius founded
the town of Convenae or Lugdunum Convenarum, so called
