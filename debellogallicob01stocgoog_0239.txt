of the soldiers (Liv. vii. 5, 5 9); iu 3¹1 they advauced their
pretensions so far as to appoint sixteen for the four legions,
or two-thirds of the whole number (Liv. ix. 3ο, 5 3); in 207,
when there vere no less thau twenty-three legions in the field,
the people elected all the tribunes for the first four, but left
the rest to be appointed hythe consuls (Liv. xxvii. 36, 55 12-
¹4)· Livy (vii. 5, 5 9) mentions that in his own day the

tribunes appointed by the commanders vvere called ‘rufuli’
Asconius (on Verr. i. 5 3ο) adds that the elected tribunes vere
called ‘comitiari'

, Thus we see that twenty-four of the tribunes vvere appointed
Ἴ hythe people‚ and the tenure of this command was with many
the first rung on the ladder of officialpromotion. The elder

Africanus was a tribune at an early age, but he, we may sup·

pose, was appointed hy his father (Liv. xxii. 53, 55 a, 3);
Marius first experienced the favour of the people in his election
lo this post by the tribes (sau. J. 63, 5 453 Caesar himself, after
his retirement to Rhodes and his escape from the pirates, began

· his career at Rome by a successful contest for the military

tribunatu (Su'et J. C. 5: Plut Caes 5).

In Caesar’s own nme the appointment by the general vas
evidently very much abused. His tribunes vere not sessoned
soldiers, but personal adherens, whom he found it convenient
to lreep in good-humour: the panic about the Germana began
with them (i. 39, 5 a). We are let into the secret of how
things vere managed hy reading Cicero's correspondeuce with
Trebatius, a very numilitary person, for whom the orator’s
influence secured a dnecuoe appointment to the tribunate in
Caesar’s army (Cle. ad Fam. vii. 8‚5 1). Among all Caesar's
tribunes the only one who mems to have distinguished himself
much as a soldier vas Gaius Volusenus (iii. 5, 5 a).

The tribunes are spoken of as Roman knights ¹. They were
mounted‚ certainly on the march (vii. 65, 5 5), aud presumably
iu the field also (ι. 25, 5 r). They formed the natural channel
