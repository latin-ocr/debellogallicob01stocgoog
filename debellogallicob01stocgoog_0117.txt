CHAPTER IV

GAUL

an Transalpinc Gaul os the Ancients was a country with Boundnries
terdeno naturai rimie, being bounded by ue Ocean on ne ‘³‘ <nn
north and west, by the Pyreneec and Mediterranean on the
south, and hy the Rhine and Alpa on the east. It was agood
deal larger than modern Franco, including in addition to it
almon ali Switzerland‚ Alsace, Lorraine‚ and the Rhine Pro-
vioces, Belgium, and part of Holland„

Except where it vergea on the Pyrenees and the Alps, the Watenhed
country ic mostiy plain: but a kind oi chine or hackbone oi {ffifm
heighta may be traced in a tortuoue line irom south to north,
dividing the country into two parts. First the Monta Corhieres
run in a northerly direction at right angles to the Pyrenees.

Then just above Carcassonne the chain turns more to the
east, while still making generally ior the north. It now goes
under the name oi the Seuthem Cevennea. The mountains
oiVirarais‚ Lyonnais, and Beaujolaia together make up the
Northem Cevennes, which run pretty nearly due north. After
these come the Montagnes du Charolais and the low hilis ol the
euterun then the Platean de Langres, where the ridge is at
iuloneet3 then the hills on the lest bank os the Mense, reaching
to the Ardennes, aiter which the chain is laintly continued ina
westeny direction until it reaches the sea near Boulogne. This
chain oi heighta constitutes the watershed oi the country. To River-

thecuat oi it are the basina oi the Rhine and ol the Rh6ne; to ''⁸⁸⁵³‘'
