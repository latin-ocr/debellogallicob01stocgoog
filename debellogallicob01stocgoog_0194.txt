¹62 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

war os the Germane over the Gauls olbis daybysayingthat
the latter had been enervated by contact with the provinces and

between by the importation of foreign luxuries. Other writers carried
(Μ’ ⁸¹¹⁶ out this hint ol caesare in a more pronounced way, and

Germana»

persisted to the end in seeing no difference but one of degree
between the Gaul and the German. ‘Take aGaul,' says Strabo
(vii 1, ξ a: cp. ir. 4, ᾗ a) in effect, ‘make him fiercer, bigger,
more yellow-haired, and you have the dweller beyond the Rhine,
rightly called by the Romans Germanus, as being a genuine,
unadnlterated savage.’ In the physical descriptione of the two
races given by ancient writers, there is nothing by which we
can discriminate Gauls lrom Germane. In connexion with
both we hear ol fierce, glaring eyes, yellow or golden hair,
white ilmbs and huge stature. The only dillerence, if it isone,
appears to be that, whereas the eyes ol the Germane are
generally represented as blue, the colour ol those ol the Gauls
does not appear to be mentioned ¹. The usual epithets
employed by Roman writers to describe the hair ol the Germane
are flavus and rutr‘lrts, which appear to have the same meaning²;

the Greeks called it ξανθόν. Seneca however (De Ira, iii. ab)

may be meant to include both Gauls and Germane.
