GAUL 97

hurry mem into unwise action. Like the Atheniens, they
were always eoger after something new (tv. 5: vii. 42, 5 a).
Caesar describes the common people as gathering round the
merehants in the country towns and forcing news from them
whether they lihed it or not, so that the demand sometimes
erased the supply3 the upper classes adopted the more politic
course ot asking the suangers to dinner, and proceeding to
interrogate them afterwards (D. S. v. 28, § 5).

There was a great simplicity and openness of character about Simplictty
the Gauls ¹, a love ol liberty (iii. ro, 5 3), and a generous sympathy 3}ny
with the oppressed (Str. iv. 4, 5 α) They scorned surprises and
stratagema in war, trusting only to strength and valour (i. 13, 5 6).

This absence oi crati was indeed one os the reasons why they Rusone
succumbed to the Romans so much sooner and more easily {HQ}

For the Spaniard hept upa scattered guerilla warsare, protecting
himself in his mountains, whereas the Gaul came on with lire

and tury, and shattered his whole strength at once against the
Roman legions (Str. iv. 4, 5 a). Another reason for the eom-
pamtively easy subjugation of the Gauls lay in their inability to
combine. Their internal animosiues were of more importante

to them than the exclusion ol the foreigner. It was the Aedui
whohroughtinthe Roman invader, and the Sequani who brought

in the German.

Though it suits Cicero's purpose, when defending Fonteius, Ptetyend

to denounce the Gauls as a sacrilegious race, they are generally immi·
taxed with the opposite extreme ol superstition (vi. 16, 5 ι).
‘Gentes superbae supeaunosae' is what Mela (iii. 5 18) says os
them They seem indeed to have been religious in their way'.
Caesar (ri. 17, 5 5) tells us how rare it was with them ior
cupidity to prevail over piety, and Diodorus (v. ay, 5 4) is
