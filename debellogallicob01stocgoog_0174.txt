frorn Posidonius ¹. Henoe it has been insened that the informa-
tion about Britain also is taken from Posidonius, and that that
philosopher had himself visited our island. But this inierence
is precarious, so longas there is no other evidence to show that
Posidonius ever was in Britain. We must therefore loolr for
another source, which we seem to find in Pytheas It is no
very violent supposition that the island Mictis, to which Timaeus
says that the Britons sailed in their consoles, is the same as the
island lctis ². Mictis, as we have already seen, is said by
Timaeus to have been the island from which the tin came;
Ictis is spoken of as that to which it was brought. The six
days' voyage is described by the historian in some phrase which
Pliny renders by the word ‘introrsum' This can hardly mean
anything but a voyage along the coast. Where then was the
island oi ictis? This question seems now to have answered
itself. Supposing the Britons to start on their voyage from the
partos the island nearest to Gaul, it would take them about
a weelr to get down to St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall, which

the description os lctis irresistibly suggests. We conclude then,
as on the whole most probable, that the account given by
Diodorus oi the Bn'tish tin-trade comes from Pytheas, and that
the island oi lctis or Mictis is St Michael's Mount⁸.

the author whom Diodorus had before him in this particular context.

it in the text ol the oue passage where it is mentioned (Plin. N. H. iv.

⁸ The Rev. Henry Fumeaux suggests that the description ol St. Michael's
Mount is due merely to its haring been even then the distingulsbing feature
oi the place, and that the tin was really shlpped hom rnore convenient
hnrbours in Mount’s Bay, such as Pennanee, Newlyn, Mousehole, Marouion.
