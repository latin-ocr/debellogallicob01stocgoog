other hero of the ranks must be mentioned here, because his
exploit supplies a missing incident in Caesar's campaign in
Britain. Some centurions who were leading the van had got
into a morass, when they were suddenly attached hythe enemy.
A private seeing their danger leapt to the rescue‚ and after
performing prodigies of valour, dispersed the foe and saved
the centurions. He had then to get himself out of the marsh,
which he did with great difficulty, partly by swimming and
partly by walling. He was met on his landing with shouts of
applause. But he himself, with a downcast air and with tears
in his eyes, threw himself at Caesar's feet, and asked forgiveness
for having lost his shield ¹. Something of the secret of Caesar's
influence is revealed to us in· the words of one who had himself
served under him, who says thatwhen things were loolring
blackest in Africa, the soldiers could find comfort nowhere,
‘save in the general’s own glauce, vigonr, and marvellous gaiety,
which told of a high and lofty spirit ln him his men found
rest, and in his slrill and wisdom all trusted to lind all things
easy to them’ (Af. 10, ξς 4, 5).

ln addition to his other qualifications as a general, Caesar
possessed an aptitude for engineering. Montaigne has re-
marlred that there is nothing on which he dwells with so much
aest as on the subtlety of his own mechanical contrivances.
This remark is illustrated hy the famous chapter on the bridge
over the Rhine (iv. ιγ), his account of which is so clear, despite
the difficulty of the subject, that General de Reffye was able
to construet a model of it ¹. lt is illustrated also hythe way
in which he enlarges on the character of his works at Alesia
(vii. 72, 73). The Gallie method of building (iv. ag) had also
a peculiar interest for him, and he admired the Gauls for their
