16 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

Tigurini (ἰ. 12,§ 7) was penned while dre glow of his honey·
moon with Calpurnia was still fresh, and in the first flush
os his alliance with the house os Piso. The friendly and
complirneutary language also in which he speaks of Pompeius
(vi. 1, ξς a, 4: vii. 6, § ι) is such as to indicate that, at the
time os writlng, there had been no open rupture between
, them. Moreover some statenmms are made in the earlier
books which do not quite tally with those in the later, as
when in ii. ahl 1 we are told that the Nervii were reduced
almost to extinction, whereas in v. 38, § 4 we find them quite
ready to take up arms again. Small discrepancies of this kind
might easily have been set right, had Caesar been anxious to
adjust his earlier to his later impressions. They serve rather
to increase thau diminish our confidence in him as a writer.

Although lastidious in his choice of words, as became one
who was the great grammatical authority ol his day ¹, Caesar
was nevertheless a quick writer. Hirtius (B. G. viii. prooem l 6)
says that his own admiration sor the Commentaries was greater
than that ol the rest ol the world; for that other people only
knew how well and correctly they were written, but that he
knew how easily and quickly.

It is now time to turn from the book to the man who wrote it.

¹ Cicero is alluding to the De Analogia οἰ Caesar when he says (Brut.
ς 261) ‘ Caesar autam rationem adhibens cousuetudinem vitiosam et corrup-
tam pura et incorrupta cousuetudine emendat' His usage iu gruum is
quoted with respect by Quintilian i. 5, 5 633 aud Aulus Gellius iv. 16, 5 8
calls him ‘gravis auctor liuguae Latinae!
