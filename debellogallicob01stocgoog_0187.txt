mutual sear. The last is the same boundary that now separates
the Tenton from the Slav. Thus the Germany ol the Ancients
was a much larger country than the German Empire oi today.
lt included all that, with the exception ol the leil bank ol the
Rhine, but it contained besides most of Holland, the whole os
Denmmk, the whole of Bobenia, with parts ol Austris,
Hungary, and Poland To these we must add the southern
ernemity of Sweden‚ which alone was known to the Ancients,
and which was universally regarded by them as an island in
the Sinus Codanus or Baltic Sea This mistake was natural
enough, since eren the redoubtable Pydueas himself had not
sailed iar enough to know that the vast promontory ol Sweden
aud Norway was connected with Europe by land at the north.
The supposed island is called by Pliny Scatinauia (tv. 5 96)
or Scadinavia (viii5 39: cp. Mela iii. 5 54), and by Ptolemy
(it ιι, 5 35) Scandia; Tacitus (G. 44‚5 a) speaks of it under
the name of Sur'onum cahr'tates.

The siae oi this vast and ill-defined country was naturally Stre
matter of much dispute. The extreme estimates were on the
oue hand that oi some writers, both Greek and Roman, who
made the sea-coast of Germany to be 25,ooo miles, and on the
other that of Agrippa, who put the whole length oi Germany
along with Raetia and Noricum at 686 miles and the breadth
at 248, on which Pliny remarks that the breadth assigned was
less than that ol Raetia alone, though he is inclined con-
jecturally to put the coast-line at something like Agrippa's
csnmate of the length The extreme length of the present

German Empire is rechoned at 740 miles, and its extreme

breadth at 580.
Pliny tells us (ii. 5 1⁶7) that the Northern Ocean was Imperfect
