Herodotus is strictly in the right in saying that the Danube V enen

comes from the country of tbe Celts, since its spring's are near f'g‘elff‘m

those of the Rhine and of the thne. But it is important to
mil abendon to the extreme vagueness with which the name
&11 was employed by the Greeks. Dio Cassius (xxxix. 49)
expressly tells us that in very early times the people who lived
on both sides of the Rhine were called Celts. He himself
allects precision by reserving the name Κελτοί for the Germans,
while calling the Gauls Γαλάται. Appian (iv. 1, a) applies the
term Celt indifferently to the Cisalpine Gauls and to their
Teutonic and Cimbrian invaders. Diodorus Siculus, on the
other hand, speaks of the Germans whom Caesar invaded as
‘the Gauls who dweli across the Danube' (v. 25, 54). The
lact is that the German to the minds of the Ancients was merely
an exaggerated and more barbarian Ganl. He was the genuine
article unsophisticated by any tinctura of civilization‚ and hence,
according to an ancient writer, he was called ‘Germanus' by

theRomans Caesarhimselflvi 24) mems inclined to something

of this view.

Strabo says that originally the inhabitants of Narbonitis only Narrower
vere called Κίλται, and that from dem the name spread (in the pceppipg ⁰s
form him) to the Gauls generally. He thinks that the influ-
enoe ol the Massilians helped to extend the name of the tribes
near thern to those more remote. This accords with Caesar's
limited nse of Celtae for the Gauls next to the Province‚ and
