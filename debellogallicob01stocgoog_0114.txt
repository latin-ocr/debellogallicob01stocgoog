Revolt ot the Allobroges brolre out into rebellium Gaius Pomptinus ¹,
ὼ ΑΠΟ· who had been praetor at Rome during Cicero’s consulship (Cic,

brugen Prov. Cous. ξ 32; Sall. Cat. 45, 5 ι), was pro-praetor in Gaul

during that year and the next. He had three lieutenants under
him, Manlius Lentinus, Lucius Marius, and Servius Galba, the

last ol whom was subsequently lieutenant to Caesar (iii. 1, ξ ).
Between them they managed to suppress the revolt, but the
Gallie general Catugnatus escaped capture (D. C. xxxvii. 47, 48).
Pomptinus was refused a triumph on some technical grounds ²,
but he waited patiently outside the pomoerium until 54, when
he at last obtained it through the aid ol Servius Galba, who had

then leit Cacsar and was praetor at Rome (D. C. xxxix. ⁶5)·
From about the time that we have now reached, dates the
ι beginning ol the end ol Gallie freedom. Gaul outside the
Province was divided into two sections. At the head of the one
were the Aedui, at the head ol the other were the Sequani and
Arverno. The Aedui derived moral support lrom their ‘ brother·
hood’ with the Romans, and physical support lrom their own
valour and their numerous dependente. One ol their osuses ol
quarrel with the Sequani was the river-dues on the thne, of
which each state claimed the control (Str. iv. 3, ς a). Alter
years ol struggling, the Aedui proved too strong sor their
Arlovtstm opponente The Arverni aud Sequani now committed the fatal
culleum mistalre of hiring aid from across the Rhine. At first 15,ooo
men came over. They lound lile more pleasant in the new
country than in their own swamps and forests, and the favour·
able reports they sent home resulted in their being soon 120‚ooo
strong. At the head ol this force was Ariovisnrs, with whom
