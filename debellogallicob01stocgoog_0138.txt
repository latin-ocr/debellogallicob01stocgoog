106 CAESAR’S GALLIC WAR

number 01 these tribes is variously esrimated. On the altar in
the temple 01 Augustus at Lyon, which was raised to him hy all
the Gerus, sirty tribes were mentioned (Str. iv. 3, 5 a). But
Josepbrrs, who is a well-informed author, speaks 01 no less than
305 (B. J. ii. 16, p. 188). The possibility 01 such &verse

estimates is no doubt due to the way iu which petty tribes were ’

grouped round more important ones as their dependants, so
that they might either be included in rhem or reckmed sepa·
rately. Strabo speaks 01 fifteen tribes of Belgae (Str. iv. 4, 5 3),
and more than twenty small tribes in Caesar's Aquitania (Str. iv.
a,§ r).

n These tribes in Caesar’s time were mosdy free, though their
constitution was decidedly aristocratical. Every now and then
however we meet with a tribe that was under hingly govemment.
Thus Galba (ii 4,5 7) was king of the Suessiones, and before
him there had been a iring Divitiacus3 Teutomatus (vii. 31, 5 5)
was iring 01 the Nitiobriges, and his father Ollovico had reigned
before him; Ambiorix and Catuvolcus were lings 01 the

Eburones (v. 24, 5 43 vi. 31, 5 5). Adiatunnus is said by
Caesar to have held the supreme command, which might mean
⁴only that he was general 01 the forces, but Nicolaus 01 Damascus

calls him King 01 the Sotiani (zSontiates) (Athen. vi. 54 b,
p. 249). There appears however to have been a great move·

ment towards freedom just before the time 01 Caesar's invasion
01 Gaul. Thus the Sequani had been under a lring Catamanta-
loedis (i. 3, 5 4); the ancestors 01 Tasgetius had reigned over
the Carnutes (v. 25, 5 r); Moritasgus had been king 01 the
Senones, in succession to his progenitore, when Caesar came
into Gaul (v. 54, 5 a). Τ1ιε descendants of these dethroned
monarcha constituted a disturblng clement in the country.
They were ready to 00110010, like Casticus (i. 3, 5 4), for the
recovery 01 a father’s sovereignty, or to accept at the hands 01
Caesar the throne from which their ancestors had been expelled
by their own people, as was the case with Tasgetius and
Cavarinus, the former of whom paid for his temerity with his
