that the motive ior their hostility to Caesar was that they were
afraid os having their commerce interiered with by his designs
on Britain. To them douhtless belonged the merchants (iv. ao,
§4l of whom Caesar inquired about Britain with so unsatisfac-
tory a result

The commodity with which the name oi Britain was chiefly The tin-
associated in the ancient market was tin. We have the authority unde.
oi Posidonius ior the statement that tin was brought from the
British Isles to Massilia (Str. iii. p. 147). Diodorus Siculus
(r. aa) bas preserved an interesting account os the tin-trade in
a period anterior to Caesar. He says that the inhabitants oi
Belerium (Cornwall) were extremely hospitable and civilised in
their way oi lise owing to their intercourse with foreign mer-
chants. They procured the tin, skiliully working the ground
which bore it. This was rocky, but had strata os earth, in which
they worked the produce, and then refined it by smelting. It
was afterwards shaped into blocks like dice, and conveyed to an
island which lay oil the coast oi Britain, and was called lctis.
To this island there was access byland at low tide, and thetin
was carted thither in wagons From there it was bought by
the merchants and conveyed to Gaul. Finally a land youmey
oi about thirty days suffioed to bring the wares on horseback to
the mouth ol the thne. A little further on (v. 38, § 5) Dio-
dorus again says that a great deal oi tin was brought from
Britain to the opposite coast oi Gaul, and then conveyed on
horsehack hythe merchants through the interior to Massilia
mdthe town called Narbo. ·

It is impossible to leave these passages without venturing
a few remarks on them. First, who was the author irom whom
Diodorus horrowed his account oi the British tin-trade? Just
before the second passage which has been quoted, Diodorus
had been correcting an error oi some historicus who had
asserted that in Spain thetin was got irom the surices, instead
ol being mined lor and smelted like silver and gold A corn·
parison with Strabo serves to show that this remark is horrowed
