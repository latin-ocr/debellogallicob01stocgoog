112 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

waters, could transform themselves into what auimals they would, ¹

could cure the incurable, could reveal the future, but refused to
do so to any save those who had come to their island for no
other purpose thau to consult them (Mela iii. § 48). There
were also strange rites among the women of the Namnetes.
On an island at the mouth of the Loire, on which no male foot
might tread‚ they held strange orgies to Bacchus, or whatever

deity corresponded to him in the Celtic Pantheon. Once a year κ
it was their custom to unroof the temple of their deity, and re· Ἴ
roof it again the same day before the sun went down. Each κ
woman came laden with her horden, but if any let it slip, the ,

rest would turn upon her like a pach of hounds and rend her
limb from limb. Such at least is the story told hy Artemidorus

whom we therefore feel responsible, have tried to explain away
Caesare account of human sacrifices in connexion with the

Druidic religion (vi. 16) as referring to au epoch earlier than his
own There is nothing however to countenance the notion that
Caesar's account is not strictly contemporary. When he is

referring to a time prior to his own, he is careful to tell us so, ¹

as in vi. 19, §g where he says that the custom of hurning

favourite slaves and retainers on the pyre of a chief was already ³
a thing of the past. ln spite of the softening of manners which ’

we have already had occasion to notice between the time of
Posidonius and that of Caesar, there seems no reason to doubt
hut that human sacrifices were a frequent practice in Gaul at
the time of the conquest. Religion is such a conservative force
that people who are otherwise civilised will not shrink from
committing atrocities under its sanction. The dogma that
‘unless for the life of man man’s life be rendered, the ¹will
of the Imrnortal Gods cannot be appeased' (vi. 16, ᾗ 3) was
rooted in the Celtic mind like a poison-plant ever ready to bear
fruitio death. Cicero in 69 nc. speaks of human sacrifices
