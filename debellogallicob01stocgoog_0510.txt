extremely desirable to get out of. He had lest the new levies which
Caesar had brought with him from Cisalpine Gaul (Μ 5) at
Agedincum (Sens), to guard the baggage, and had advanoed with
his four legions upon Paris, which was then confined to the island
in the Seine, on which the cathedra! of Notre Dame now stands
He probably followed the left bank of the Yonue and Seiue. On
his way he found himself confronted by an old and experieuoed
general, Camulogenus the Auleroun, who hed been enh-osted with
the command of a large army, and who, by avalling himself of the
natural barrier of a marsh, made the further progress of labienus
in this direction impossible. The marah in question is supposed
by Napoleon 111 to have been formed by the Essonne‚ near where
it flows into the Seine at Corbeil. At all events it was above Paris
and below Melon. For Labienus made a midnight march back to
Melum, seized some fifty vessels, surprised the town, which hlre
Paris was on an island of the Seine, repaired a bridge which the
enemy had broken down, transported bis army across, and resumed
his march to Paris on the opposite bank When the enemy were
apprised of this manoeuvre, they burnt Paris and cutthebridgee η

Just at this time Labienus heard of Caesar's ill fortune with ’
additions due to Gallie imagination. The Bellovaci too began to
threaten himself. His one desire therefore now was to get back

to his base at Agedincum But he had put himself on the wrong ι

banlr of the Scine for his present purpose, being exposed to an
attack from the Bellovaci, and being shut off by thet river itself

(before its junction with the Yonne)‚ from the point at which he 1

was aiming. lt was true that Camulogenus and bis army were on
the left bank, but something must be risked, and Labienus deter-

mined to fight them. But how cross the river in face of the ,

enemy? This was acoomplished by an elaborate ruse, whereby
Labienus, while making a feint of crossiug above Paris towards
Melun, really couveyed his army across at a point four miles below
his camp. Camulogenus and his army were cut to pieoes after
a stubbom resistance‚ Labienus picked up his baggage and reserves
at Agedincum and joined Caesar with all bis forces et some point
which has not been mentioned.

On the defection of the Aedui the war assumed larger propor-
tions. They had Caesar's hostnges from Gaul in their power and
