The chief produce is deelared by Strabo to bave been corn, hadrec.
cattle, gold, silver, and iron. Tacitus notices tlre absence ol
the olive and vine and other products ol a warmer elimate, but
says that apart from these the country is fertile and well suited
lor crops He adds that the latter spring up quiclrly but ripen

slowly, and assigna the same cause sor both laets, namely, the
abnndance ol moisture in the soil and atrnosphere. Caesar’s
statement (v. ra, ξ 5) that all the trees of Gaul were to be found
in Britain, with the exception of the ‘lagtrs' and ‘abies' has given
rise to much controversy. With regard to tlre latter, Loudon¹
finds an easy way out oi tbe difficulty by identisylng it, not with
the Scotch pine, which is believed to be indigemus, but with
the silver fir, of which he says that it ‘not only does not grow
wild in England‚ but was not introduced into this country till
modern times! With regard to the former, the simplest explana-
tion seems to be that Caesar did not happen to notice any
beeches during his hurried visits to Kent ².

os Lucullus over Mithridates, about the year of the city 680
(nc. 73). Lucullus first brought theru from Pontus, and rao
years later they crossed the ocean into Britain (Plin. N. H. xv.

quince (qdonr'rsnr) from Crete, and the apricot (Armeniacum)
from Armenia Tbe ‘herba Britannica,’ which played an impor-
