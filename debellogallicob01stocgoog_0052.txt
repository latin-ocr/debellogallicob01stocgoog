20 CAESAR'S GAatrc WAR

Ruthless- to say about Caesar's clemency. He set s glorious example

agnina

to hia countryrnen, and one which they surely needed,' tn the

meme magnanimity which enabled him to forgive the most exasperat·

ing injurias aud insults. In the matter ol the Gallio War,
however, it must be confessed that, ii we were not told of
Caesar's clemency‚ we should have difficulty in discovering it
sor ourselves Barbarians perhaps, mere Gauls aud Germans,
were hardly to be counted as within the pale ol humanity. The
6‚ooo Helvetii who attempted to escape after their surrender he
bad brought back, and, to use his own curt phrase, ‘in hostium
numero habuit' Nothing more is said—for alter tltat there was
nothing moreto say ol them. The rest ol the Helvetii he shep-
herded back to their own country, asDiodorus puts it, preferring
their occupancyol it to that ol the Germana, who were pretty sure
to step into their place. The Veneti surrendered to him uncon-
ditionally. He put all their senate to death and sold the rest
into slavery. This was a lesson to them, he tells us, to observa
the rights of ambassadors (B. G. iii. 16, 54; cp. 9, 5 3). But the
Veneti had not selzed ambassadors, as Caesar himself did sub-
sequently. Their oflence was to have retained some of Caesar's
officers who were sent to get corn, in the hope of thereby
recovering their own hostages (iii. 7, 5 3). 8oo German cavalry
had dispersed 5,oooofCaesa1‘s while negotiations were going
on. When the leaders ol' the Usipetes and Tencteri came in
a body to apologiae lor this ‘regrettable incident,' Caesar seiaed
them, surprised their encampment, and sent his cavalry to cut
down the women aud children (iv. 14, 5 5). It was his severity
to Acco that was among the main causes of bringing about the
great revolt ol Gaul in s. c. 52 (cp. vi. 44, 5 a, and vii. 1, § 4).
At the capture οἰ Avaricum his soldiers spared neither age nor
sex (vii. 28, 5 4; cp. 47, 5 5). For this perhaps Caesar is

hardly to be held responsible, lor the men are not always as
humane as their general, justas the hounds sometimes differ
ln their views hom the huntsmen. Nor, though it does not
exalt our idea of his humanity, is he perhaps to be blamed ior
