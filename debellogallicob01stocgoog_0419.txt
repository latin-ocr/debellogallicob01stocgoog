DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ. V 155

The men of the seventh legion made short work of this by raising
a mound against it under the protection of a roof of shields The
enemy were expelled, but Caesar did not deem it advisable to
pursue them far that day. He was doing so on the next when
news was brought to him of a disaster to his lieet This led hirn
