in the Belgian names ol British tribes Caesar has not himself
recorded any of these names, hut we find mention in Ptolemy
ol ’Δτροβάτιοι (ii. 3, ξ ab) and oi lte'lyat (ib. ξ 28), both os them
south of the Tharnes, and of nepteo: (ξ 17) north ol the
Humber. We may also recall to mind in this connexion our
authoffs statement that Divitiacus, the lring of the Suessiones,
had in a period which he describes as ‘within our own memory’
extended his sway over Britain (ii. 4, ς 7).

Diodorus speaks of the races which inhabited Britain as
‘autochthonous,' without attempting any distinction. The land
was uutouched, he says, by foreign invasion, and neither
Bacchus nor Hercules nor any of the heroes was reported
to have made an expedition against it.

Tacitus throwsa greater air of science into his speculatione
on this point The red hair and large limbs ol the Caledoniaus
he thinks indicative ol a German origin, whereas the swarthy
complexions of the Silures (South Wales), the prevalence
among them ol curly hair, and the vicinity os Spain argue an
early Iberian settlement in this part ol Britain. The parts
nearest to Gaul he thinks it reasonable to suppose were peopled
lrom that country, and in support of this conclusion he adduces
the similanty that could be observed between Gauls and
Britons in religion, language, and character.

We need not pay much attention to Tacitus' suggestion ol
an ethnological affinity between the Caledonians and Germans.
As to his idea olan immigration direct lrom Spain, it is founded
on a geographica} blunder. Tacitus shared in Strabo's error
that the west of Britain lay quite close to Spain. Neither ol
them thought ol Gaul as having, properly speaking, a west
coast at all, but imagined the ocean-board as sloping continu-
ously lrom the Rhine to the Pyrenees ¹. With these abate·

writer ol that treatise says (3, t 11) ol the Ocean—iffra κατ’ ὀλίγον ὑπὲρ
