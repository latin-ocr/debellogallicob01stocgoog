under the Servian census, wore a complete corslet of chain·

mail. To increase the terrors ol their appearance, all three
divisione had their helmets surmounted by a crown ol {cathers

The ‘triarii' acted 'principally as a reserve. The word ‘suh Tne inani.

sidium’ is declared by the etymologists to be derived from their

at a distance. By their side was a Spanish swerd, which they
would draw, after shilting the spears to their left, il there were
need ior action at close quarters. The poet Varro Atacinus
