194 CAESAR-S oAttrc ΜΚ

Caesar· legion (i. 7, 5 a; 8, 5 ι). He at once raised soldiers irorn the
&⁰¹¹² Province, levied two legions in Cisalpine Gaul, and brought out
three from their winter-quartem at Aquileia (ἰ. ιο, 5 3).

The soldiers froru the Province seem to have come under the
head ol auxiliaries. Thus Caesar started at once with six
legions, though he had only been appointed to the command
ol iour. Oi these six, iour were composed oi veteraus aud the
two levied in Cisalpine Gaul of tirus, to these latter was
assigned the care oi the baggage during the battle with the
Helvetii (i. 24, 55 2, 3). Oi the iour veterau legions one was
the famous Tenth (i. 40, 5 15; 42, 5 5)

During the winter which lollowed the lirst campaign two new
legions were levied iu Cisalpine Gaul; iu the spring os ac. 57
these were seut into Further Gaul under the command of
Quintus PedIus (ii. a, 5 ι) Thus Caesar had eight legions
athis disposal whenhe commenced operations against the
Belgae. six ol these were now senoned veterans and bore
the brunt of the fighting in the battle of the Sambre (ri. 2ο, 5 ¹3),
while the two recent levIes were again assigned the charge ot'
the baggage (ii. 19, 53 ς 26, 5 3). In the account oi this battle
we get the names, or rather the numbers, oi tbe six legions
engaged The IXth and Xth were victoriousover the Atrebates
(ii. 23, 5 ¹l5 the XIth and VIIIth drove back the veromandui

(5 3); the XIIth and VIIth were roughly handled by the
Nervii (54). Thus we get a continuous series of legions—VII,
VIII, IX, X, XI, XII; aud, as Dio Cassius (xxxviii. 47, 5 2)
informs us that Caesar's legions were numhered according

to the order oi their enlistment, it follows that the two which
were not actively engaged were the XIch and XIVth Ii we
conjecture that X was the legion which was in Gaul from
the first, it will follow that VII, VIII, and IX were the three
that were brought from Aquileia, and XI and XII the two first
levied in Cisalpine Gaul. Soon aiter the battle the VIIth legion
was despatched under Publius Crassus to the Armorican states
and spent the winter iu Anj0u (ii. 343 iii. 7, 5 2). We hear ol
