DE BELLO GALcho. ΗΒ. VI! 247

used them to coerce waverers. Their own sense of their services
was so great that they claimed the supreme command as against
Ariovistus. But in a eouncil of all Gaul held ut Bibracte the
national hero was confirmed in his position by a unanimous vote
of the people. lle pursued his old tactics of avoiding a general
engagement end trying to starve the Romans out of the country,
but at the same time he supplied them with an additional motive
for leaving by organizing attacks upon the Prnvince. These were
resisted partly by the provincials themselves and partly by Lucius
Caesar with twenty-two cohorts, who was acting as lieutenant to
his cousin. The Proconsul himself, blocked by the Gauls from
communication with the Province and Italy, sought aid from
beyond the Rhine, and reinforoed himself with that mixed cavalry
and infantry of the Germans, which he regarded as so effective.
Acting on the principle of assigning the best instruments to the
best performers, Caesar substituted the horses of his own officers
for the poorer animale that these allies had brought with them.
The success which awaited him may be traced in grem measure to
this piece of wisdom, since on subsequent critical occasions it was
the Germana who decided the fate of the day.

is the surprising turn of fortune that now followed Caesar was in
full retreat to the Province, being somewhere on the border between
champagne and F rauche Comte (66, § 2), when Vercingetorix
encamped within ten miles of him. So confident were the Gauls
in the superiority of their cavalry that the knights bound them
selves by a solemn vow not to return to their homes till they
had ridden twice through the ranks of the enemy. Nevertheless,
the Gallie cavalry were utterly defeated, chiefly by the aid nf the
Germans, and Vercingetorix, despain'ng of holding the field, shut
himself up in the hill-fortress of Alesia.

lf we had any certain clue to the locality of this last battle, we
should have some ground to go on from the text of the Com-
mentaries in determining the site of Alesia As it is, we only know
that on the day after (altero dr'e, 68, i a) a battle which took place
in the territory of the Lingones Caesar pitched his camp at Alesia
Napoleon ΙΙΙ makes out the battle to have taken place on the
Vingeanne, near Longeau; but this is pure conjecture and is out
of keeping with his own far better grounded view that Alesia is
