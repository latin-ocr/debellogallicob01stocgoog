Paternus, whom Vegetius (i. 8) calls ‘diligentissimus iuris mili-
tan's adsertor,’ may be assumed to be the ‘Tarroutenus Patemus,'
author of a work in four books De Re Militaui, who is quoted in
the Digest (xlirr. 16, 7) as an authority on martial law. He
was at one time in command of the Praetorians, and afterwards

Commodus (D. C. lxxii. 5). Oi more value perhaps even than

ot' Cicero to depreciate the former in comparison with oratory
and the art of war, but from a less biassed source we get
a juster judgment, which puts all three pursuits on a level ¹.

'And as in law, so in war the Romans displayed that wise
conservatism, which gave them their hold upon history.

The Roman army was an institution, whose growth was TheRomm
coeval with that of the city itsell. The very name of ‘ maniplos,¹ mn?
