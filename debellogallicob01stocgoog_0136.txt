104 CAESAR'S GALLIC rm

Diodorus (D. S. v. 27, §l r, ι) describes its rivers as running
with gold. We have already had occasion to notice the extensive
use ol gold in ornaments and the sacred treasures that existed
in various parts ol the country. The Genls had s strange

, habitos committing these mensures lor sale-keeping to the
lakes When the Romans got possession of the country these ,

lakes were sold by the state, and the purchasers sometimes

discovered mill-stones ol solid silver. The treasures at Tolosa, η

which were sacked hy Caepio, are said to have been ol the value
of 15,ooo talents ¹. They consisted of unwrought gold and

silver,a lact which, spart from other arguments, is fatal to the ¹
ides os Timagenes that these treasures had been brought home ’

hythe Tectosages from Delphi Whenever we read in Livy oi
a victory over Gauls, we are pretty sure to be told afterwards
ol the amount ol gold and silver that wss carried in triumph.
The arms oi the Gauls were richly adorned with these metnls,
and when Bituitus (see p. 73) wss carried in triumph in Rome,
it was in the silver car in which he had lought (Flor. i. 37, ς 5).
His father Luemins¹ had so much money to spare that he once
rode through the plains scattering gold and silver from his car
to the assembled multitudes ol his countrymen. The same
ostentatious monarch enclosed a space os twelve stades square
in which there were vars filled with costly liquor, and rables
served with iood continuously for all comere during several days.
A minstrel who came too late sor the good cbeer met the
monarcb in his car. He celebrated the royal magnificence and
bewailed his own missortune. Bituitus was so plessed that he
called sor a purse ol gold, and flung it to the singer‚ who picked
it up as he ran beside the car, and tben burst into s grateful
ebant, declating that the very ground which was pressed by his
charior wheels was productive of gold and blessings to men.
These stories come from the twenty-third book of Posidonius.
