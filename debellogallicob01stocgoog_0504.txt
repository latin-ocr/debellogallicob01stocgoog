of Caesare line, s point which depende on the hypothetical position
of Gorgobina, there was very good resson for a detonr in order
to reach it, aod the signal wengeance which Caesar took upon
it seems to mark it as the plaoe where Roman citizens were
murdered.

The continuone success of the Roman arms convinced Vercinge-
torix that the Gauls must change their tactics He had influenoe
enough with his countryrnen to persuade them to play a waiting
geme, despite their natural impatience, and to hum their home·
steads, villeges, and ewen towns, so as to deprire the enemy of the
means of subsistence. Avaricum itself, upon which Caesar was
now menching, ought in porsuance of this plan to have been
committed to the tlarnes; hut Vercingetorix at length yielded to
the entreaties of the Bituriges that they might nothe compelled
to destroy with their own hands a city which was the fairest almost
in the whole of Gaul, and whose nannai position made it so easy
of defence. ln this he committed an error of policy‚ for the
subsequent capture of this stronghold just saved the Romans frorn
being started out of the country. Vercingetorix encsmped at
a distance ol sixteen miles from it, and with his abundant mrwlry
mede foraging a work of difficulty and danger to the Romans.
There were only two tribes in Gaul from whom Caesar could
expect help in the way of supplies These were the Boii and the
Aedui, of whom the former were too poor to do much, and the
latter too half-hearted The legionaries were forced for several
dsys to subsist solely on meat, which presented itself as an extreme
privation to these Italian soldiers accustomed to farinaoeous food.
N evertheless, they held on with e dogged persistente, and reiected
Caesar’s offer to abandon the siege

When the towers had dready approached the wall, Vercingetorix
moved his camp nearer to Avaricum, and left it himself with the
cavalry, in order to lie in ambush where he expected the Romans
to go out to forage next day. Caesar was informed of this move-
ment‚ and starting at tnidnight presented himself in the morning

before the camp deserted by its general He found the position
however too strong to justify an attack, os the enemy were
protected hy a march, and returned the same day to continue the
siege. The fickle Gauls accused their commender of treachery,
hut Vercingetorix had no difficulty in disposing of the arguments
