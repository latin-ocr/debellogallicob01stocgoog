DE BELLO GALLICO. ΗΒ. VII 239

proceeded to lay siege to Gorgobina, the town os those Boii who
had been settled on Aeduan territory (i. 28, t ς). This movement
on the part os Vercingetorix put Caesar in a great difficulty. On
the one hand he could not with credit desert the dependants ol the
Aedui, on the other the season was still too early to make it easy
to obtain supplies. The loss ol prestige appeared the greater ol
the two evils: so Caesar sent word to the Boii that he was coming
to their relies, and set out from Sene with eight legions. N ext day
he arrived at Vellaunodunum, a town of the Senones, which he
stopped to talre. Two days more brought him to Cenabum on the
Loire‚ which belonged to the Carnutes. This town he sacked and
hurnt. 'lben he crossed the Loire and laid siege to a town ol the
Bituriges called Noviodunum, which lay in. his line oi march.
This was in the act ol surrender when the cavalry oi Vercingetorix,
who had now raised the siege ot Gorgobina, carne to its relies:
but these were routed by some German horse in Caesasss service,
ol whom we now hear lor the first time, and the surrender was
completed. At'ter these successes Caesar marched upon Avaricum,
the chiel town oi the Bituriges, feeling sure that, it he could recover
that, he would reduce the tribe into his power.

There has been much dispute as to the topography oi this march
of Caesar's. Agedincum, it is not questioned, is Sens. Vellauno-
dunum is placed by the commission, whom Napoleon ΙΙΙ instructed

to draw up a map oi Gaul, at chaman-handen, on the south border
ol the department of scisset-Merme, but by the Emperor himself
at Trigueoes. Genabum is identified hythe same Commission
with Orleans, hythe Emperor with Gien, which is further up the
Loire. Noviodunum is put by the Commission at Neuvy·sur-
Baranjon, by Gdler at N ouan le Fuzelier, by Napoleon at Sancerre.
Gorgobina, r'or which Gergovia used to be read, is placed hythe

Commission at Saint-Pierre·le-Moutier, by Gbler at Guerche-sur-
l’Aubois, hy Napoleon at Salat-Panae le Chatel. M. Desjardins
believes that the Cenabum ol vii. 11, 14 is not the same as the
Cenabum ol vii. 3 and viii. 5. The latter place he identifies
with Orleans, and maintains that it should be spelt with a C,
because it is so spelt in an inscription found on the spot and by
Ptolemy (ii. 8, ὁ 13), though not by Strabo (iv. 2, d 3). The
former, he is willing with the Emperor to plaoe at Gien. This
compromise has little to recommend it. Even it Orleans were out
