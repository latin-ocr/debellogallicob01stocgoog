The internal animosities of the Celts nov began to aet to their
own detriment in Britain as in Gaul. The king of the Trinobantes,
a powerful tribe in Esset, had been slain by Cassivellaunus,
aud his sou Mandubracius had taken refuge with Caesar on the
Continent. The Trinobantes now ashed to have Mandubracius
restored to them and protected against Cassivellaunus. They
gave hostages to Caesar and supplied him with corn. Other trabes
followed their example, and soon the ‘town' of Cassivellaunus,
which was only some earthworks in a place mntected by woods
and marshes, was taken by storin. The British general now sent
orders to the four kings who tbeu reigned in Kent to make

adiversiou in his favour by an attach ou the naval camp of the
Romans. When this was foiled Cassivellaunus was ready to come

to terma with Caesar, a matter iu which he employed the good
offices ol Commius. Caesar took bostages, iurposed a tribute ou
Britain, and threatened Cassivellaunus with pains and penaltiss, if
he molested Mandubracius or the Trinobantes. Owing to the loss
of ships and the number of captives the army had to be brought
back iu two relays The ships, when retuming empty, were rnet
by a storm, and very few of thern could make their place of
destination3 the rest had to put back. Caesar waited for them
for some time, but the equinos was again at haud, so he crowded
all the rest ol his men on board the few ships he bad, and by good
luclr got them across salely. He left Britain about nine iu the
evening and reached laudat daybrealr.

Before Caesar left Britain he received the news of the death
of his daughter Julia (Seu Cous. ad Marc. 14), an event
pregnant with consequentes, which however do not concern us
here.

We must be content to lorgo the idea of following in the foot-
steps of Caesar in Britain, for we do not even know the point from
which he started.

Mr. Lewin lande him on Romney Marah, near Lymne, which
was iu those days a baren, as the name is thought to indicate
The river, at which the Britons first offered resistance (9, l 3) he
identifies with the Great Stour near Wye. The silvan stroughold,
which fell before the seventh legion (9, §y 4, 7), he finds in Challock
