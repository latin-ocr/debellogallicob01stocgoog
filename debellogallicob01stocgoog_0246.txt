By Caesar’s ‘inferiores ordines' then let us understand what
Polybius meant by the centurions oi the second choice, who
commanded the lest oi the maniple in battle (oo-31 above),
and by his ‘superiores ordines' the centurions of the first choice,
who commanded the right oi the maniple (go-1 above). Each
cohort consisted of one maniple called ‘hastatus' one called
‘princeps’ and one called ‘pilus' and thus contained six
centurions in all, three os the lower and three oi the higher
grade. The ‘ordo’ or maniple and the officer who com·
mandeti it were spoken oi by the same name3 hence ‘primi
ordines' means certain centurions. When it was necessary
to distinguish the centurion oi the higher irom that oi the lower
grade in the same maniple, it was done by adding ‘prior'
or ‘posterion’ The number oi the cohort was indicated by
the ordina] numerals. Thus ‘princeps prior' and ‘princeps
primus' are different in meaning and both ambiguous A cen·
turion might be ‘princeps prior' in any oi the ten cohorts3
ii called ‘princeps primus' or ‘primus princeps’ he must
belong to the first cohort, but might be oi the higher or lower
grade. Caesar allows oi no misunderstanding when he speaks
(C. iii. 64, i 4) of ‘primae cohortis princeps prior‚' hut thetide
of the same officer is cut down by Livy (xxv. 14, ξ 7) to

‘princeps primus centurio ' and even to ‘princeps' (ibid. ξ 13).
By the ‘primi ordines ' we may understand the ten ‘pili priores,'
whom Marquardt plausibly conjectures to have had the command
oi the whole cohort

Polybius. whereas in Caesar's time the ‘primi ordines' as a whole were
admitted. This is perhaps a natural consequence oi the decline
in the efficiency ol the tribunes between the two periods.
