tenant Sabinus had entered the territory oi the Venelli, where he
found himself sace to iace with a formidable combination ol states
under the nominandos a chief named Viridovix. The Aulerci
Eburovices (Evreux) and lexovii were at first restrained by their
senates from joining the alliance, hut in a t'ew days they massacred
their senates, closed their gates, and made common cause with
Viridovix. The position of a Gallie senate was in those days not
an enviahle one. We have seen one senate murdered by Caesar
lor making war upon him, and now we see others murdered by the
Gauls ior not making war upon him. Sabinus toolr up a strong
position, and refused all offers oi an engagement. ‘lhe confidenoe
oi the Gaula rose, while their commisserint ran out. Sabinus hired

then unmaslred their infantry, which lay in ambush in a valley.
Crassus was suocessiul in both encounters, and pressed the siege oi
their town so vigorously as to induce them to surrender, notwith-
standing their skill in mining. While the surrender was being
made the commander-in·chief, Adiatunnus, made au attempt to
escape with 600 devoted touowers. He was repulsed, but was
allowed the same terrns ol smrender as the rest

When Crassus advanced against the Vocates and Tamsatee
(tribes whose position is not determined), the whole oountry ssew
to arms ; ‘aid was even sought from Spain, and leaders were chosen
who had learnt the art oi war under Sertorius. Crassus found that
their tactics were to play a waiting game and cut him oli from
