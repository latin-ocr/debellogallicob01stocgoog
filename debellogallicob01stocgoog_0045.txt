It is applied to any short composition which is intended
rather sor use than sor show, such as a skeleton speech ¹,
a lecture note-book (Quint. ii. rr, ς 7), official memoranda
(Liv. vi. r, § a: Quint. viii. 2,§1a), or a biographical memoir
<Suet Tib. 61). We have the express authority oi Hirtius
(Β. G. w’ii. Prooem ξ 23 30, 5 1 ; 48,§10)foritsapplication to

Caesar's books on the Gallie War as well as that of Cioero
(Brut ξ 262). It was also the name given by Gaius to his four
books os Institutes. It corresponds in part to the Greek
iorum and in part to ὑπόμνημα (Cic. ad Att. ii. 1, ξ a), and may

Caesar then, by the title which he has conferred upon his
work modestly intimates that he does not regard himself aa
rrifing history, but only as supplying materiata for others
lo work up. But, as Cicero has finely said in the Brutus (ξ ada)
‘in wishing that others who meant to write history might have
matter at hand to take from, he has perhaps conferred a favour
upon lools‚ who may try to crimp and curl the bare beauty
os his style; but he has deterred men of sense from writing3
lor there is nothing more delightful in historical composition
than a plain and luminous brevity¹.’

ln one respect the planos writing, even in the Commentaries, Tse
gives some scope for the display ol that force which Quintilian ΨΜ ¹
dwells upon as characteristic ol Caesar's oratory (Inst. Or. i. 7,
§342 s. 1, ξ ¹143 a,§ 25: xii. ro, 5 11), and that is in the
Speeehes. The speecbes in ancient writers are not supposed
lo be genuine. They constitute the dramatic element in
history, Their merit is not to say what was actually said,
but to say what was appropriate to the occasion. Thackeray,
I think, remarks somewhere that he would have made a most

commentarium paulo plenius?
