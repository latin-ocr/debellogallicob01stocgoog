Tencteri, had accepted Caesar’s invitation to plunder, and had
already harried some cattle of the Eburones But they were not
particular as to the source whence their spoil came, and having
been informed by a captive that Caesars beadquarters could be
reached in three bourn, and had been left poorly guarded, they had
gleefully selred the opportunity and rode up to the decuman gate
just at this most awlrmrd moment. 'lbere was a wild panic in
the camp, and it was with difficulty that the gates were held
against thern Fortunately for the Romans the hrave centurion,
Publius Sextius Baculus, bad been leit invalided in the garrison
Though so ill that he had been without food for live days, he
selred arms from the bystanders and toolr his plane at the gate
He had soon to be carried off in a swoon, but his example was
followed hythe other centurione of the cohort on duty, and the
men gained courage to talre their places on the works and present
an appearance of defenoe. Meantime the five cohorts, who had
now done their foraging, caught the sound of shouting in the
distance. Unused to war they looked to their officere for dhecdon,
but met with nothing but dismay and divided oounsels, while the
enemy. perceiving their small numbers, promptly attacked thern.
The veterane made a successful dash for the camp and were
followed by the camp-followers and cavalry3 but the recruits, who
hesitated between defending themselves hya height and making
for the camp, were so severely handled by the enemy that two
cohorts were lost. The Germans now thought fit to retire‚ but
they left such abject terror behind them that when Caesar's cavalry
arrived the same night they were not believed when they declared
that the army was safe On Caesar's own return he abstained
frorn reproach, complaining only of the oohorts having been allowed
to leave the camp, which it was their duty to protect.

After another expedition in search of Ambiorix, and a still more
searching devastation of his territorias, Caesar led back his forces
to Reims (Durocortorum Remorum), where he convened the council
of Gaul, instituted an inquiry into the conspiracy among the
Senones and Carnutes, and eracted vengeanee from its author

Acco by a cruel and degrading form of execution. After this be
settled his legions in winter-quartem and himself set out for
Cisalpine Gaul.
