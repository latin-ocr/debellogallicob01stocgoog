GAUL 109

They acted as a court oi public arbitration, and the most
important private suits, especially those ior murder, were
intrusted to their care (vi. 13, 5 5; Str. iv. 4, 5 4). To enlorce
their decisions they possessed the dreaded power of excommuni-
eation (vi. 13, 5 6).

The immortality oi the soul, which to the Greeks andBelielin
Romans was the dream oi the philosopher, was with the Gauls iffi*
a part oi the popular creed. The Druids are credited with
leaving taught this doctrine with the object ol making men
despise death in battle ( “. ι4, 5 ἐς Mela iii. 5 19; Lucani.

Ι 460-2). But whether their motive was utility or speculative
conviction, they certainly succeeded in impressing the belief
upon the minds oi their countrymen, by whom it was held with
a startling vividness. When some one died, people would take
the opportunity oi posting letters to their friends who had gone
before; it these werc burnt along with the body of the deceased
on the pyre, the contents, it was imagined, would pass with him
into the Kingdom os Souis (D. S. v. 28, 5 6). And when life
was over, the thought was still cf life, so that men equipped their
relatives for a new existence by buming or burying with thern
astoclr cs implements. Sometimes even the settlement of debts
was transferred tc the aiter-world, which was not considered
equivalent to apcstponement sr'rre die (V al. Max. ii. 6, 5 ro). Illile
seemed intolerable when the loved was lost, the pyre was there,
which would enable the mourner, not to die, but to live with him
(Mela iit 5 19). The only real measure of belief is what a man
is prepared to act upon. Apply this test, and we shall be forced
to admit that the heliel in a future lise was held in those dim
ages with a tenacity to which it has never since attained. ·

The precise form oi the doctrine which was inculcated by the Metam-

Druids was, we are told, metempsychosis (vi. 14, § 53 D. S. v. 1²⁸7⁰¹²⁰⁵i⁵·
28, 5 6). Herein their teacbing resembled that ol Pythagoras,

bnt there is no evidence to show that they included in it
transmigraticn into animal forms.
