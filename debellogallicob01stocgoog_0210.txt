178 cassans satire ware

Josephns. 'the short account given by josephus in his Jewish War¹ of
those Roman armies, against which he had himself contended.
In his pagos we seem to hear the tramp oi the legions as they
pursue their march, inexhaustible ia resources, irresistible in
might, and can still leel the shiver which their approach sent
through the hearts oi the brave bnt undiseiplined ‘barbatiane'

Vegetius ot Vegetius personally nothing is known. lt cannot even be

:flffhfflm inserted irom his work that he was himself a military man. He
wrote in a time of degeneracy and defeat with a view to
restoring the old Roman training and in particular the use of

dolensisc annom, the discondnuance oi which Gibbon declares

to have been ‘the immediate cause oi the downiall ol the
empire.' Vegetius mentions as his authorities Cato the Censor,
Cornelius Celsus, Frontinus, and Paternus, together with the
‘constitutions' oi Augustus, Traian, and Hadrian: but the use

which he makes os these materiale is so uncritical that we never
know oi what period he is speaking. Cato died in ac. ¹49·
His work De Re Militari is quoted also by Aulus Gellius
(vi. 4, ξ 5). Cornelius Celsus (about nn. 50) is better known
to us as the Latin wn'ter on medicine: but his was an en·
cyclopaedic genius, which embraced all subjecta, though Quin·
tilian (xii. rr, ξ 24) pronounces him to have been a man oi
only moderate ability. Julius Frontinus was succeeded by
Agricola in the command ol Britain in the year sn. 78. He
is called ‘a great man' by Tacitus (Agr. 17), and he had
shown his practical acquaintance with the art oi which he wrote
by the subjugation oi the Silures, the most powerful tribe in
South Wales. He took part also in putting down the revolt
os Julius Civilis, arrd received the surrender oi the Lingones
(Front. iv. 3, 5 14). The work of his which has come down to
us under the name oi ¹ Strategematon' is not his treatise on the
art oi war, which has unfortunately perished, but a series oi
anecdotes after the manner ol Valerius Maximus, only shorter
aud more sorappy, intended to equip the general with aamples

menomenas.
