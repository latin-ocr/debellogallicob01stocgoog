THE ROHAN Am 185

vere themselves superior on foot They accordingly trained
young and active men, carrying each a buckler and seven darts
(‘iacula’) with points like those used by the ‘velites’ to ride
behind the cavalry-soldier aud dismoum when they came to
the scene of action. This device is said to have been invented
bya centurion, Q. Navius, vho received honours in consequence
from the general Fulvius Flaccus. After this time ‘velites' in
this special sense vere made an integral part of the Roman
legions (Liv. xxvi. 4 ; Val. Mu. ii. 3, § 3). This mixed force,
which combined tbe velocity of cavalry with the stability of
infantry, vvas found extremely effective in Macedonia against
King Philippus (rac. aco) ¹. We read also of mounted ‘velites'
being employed by Metellus against Jugurtha in luc. 109
(Sall. J. 46), but after this they disappeared, when the whole
legion vas made uniform by Marius. It seemed therefore to
Caesar a new ides when he encountered such a force among
the Germana, and he was not slovr in availing himself of it

as German Livy (xliv. 26) describes it among the Gauls in
Illyricum, and Caesar himself mentions its use by Vercingetorix
(vii. 18, § 1; cp. 8ο, 5 3). Vegetius (iii. 16) speaks of the
employment of ‘ velites' as an excellent device for strengtbening
cavalry and as being ln accordance with the custom of the
mcieuts, but he is mistalten when be tells us in another place
