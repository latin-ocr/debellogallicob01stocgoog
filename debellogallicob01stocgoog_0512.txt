Aliso-SaluteReIne The scene assigned hythe Emperor to the ἵ

battle is 65 hilornetres Irom Aliae, so that he is obliged in
the teeth oi all LatInists to take altero die as meaning not ‘the
next day,' but ‘the second day alter! If therefore there were
none but textual evidence, it might be difficolt to decide nervom
the conflicting claims for the honour oiidentity with Alesia pot
lorward by the supportem or' Aliae-SainteReine in Burgundy aod
oi allaize-Iessalms in Franche Comte But tbe controversy may
now be considered to bave been settled by the spade in favour ol
the former place. When the very stimuli (73, I 9), which Caesar
lixed in the ground to incommode the tread ot unwary antagonists,

responded to his call, not iudeed hythe universal Ievy lor which
he bad asked, which they thought would be unmanageable, but by
ample contingents from the several states. But their coming was
delayed beyond the time expected, and the 80,000 men shut up In
