manners, we are told, were marked by a frank honesty and an
absence of luxury (D. S. v. ar, §6); the war-chariots, too,
which had long vanished from Greece, were to he seen here
in full play. One difference was noticed between the British
warriors and those described by Homer, namely, that the
person of chief consequence took the reins ¹. This surprised
the Greeks, and still more the Romans, who thought driving
undignified.

Caesar (iv. 33) has described with admiration the skill of the war-
essedarii, or, as Tacitus calls them, covinnarri '.(Agr 35, 36), rn ‘hm‘
managing their small hut swilt horses (D. C. lxxvi. rr). He also
admits the terror that was caused among bis own men when
this mode of fighting was still strange to them (v. 15, ς 4).
Although Strabo speaks of the Britons ‘using chariots in war
for the most part, like some of the Celts,' and Lucan ascribes
the practice to the Belgae ¹, yet Caesar certainly leads us to
infer that this feature was peculiar, iu his experience, to
Britain. ·

Beyond their use of chariots Caesar has left us no description Eqnipment
of the equipment or mode of fighting of the enemy whom he figffi
encountered' m Britain. We have to eke out his deficiencies
hy the accounts of later writers, which relate chiefly to the
Caledonians, who were then the enemy. It is douhtless they
whom Tacitus had iu view when he said that the strength of
the Britons lay in infantry, though some trihes fought from the
chariot. Dio Cassius also praises the infantry of the Cale-
donians, saying that they were swilk in running sud sturdy
in a wale. Their weapons were a shield and short spear,
with a brazen bullat its buttend, which swuugloose, so us
to make a cletter and frighten the enemy: they also wore dirks. ·
Herodian (iii. ¹4) speaks to much the same effect, saying that
they wore only a narrow shield and spear, with a sword sluug by
