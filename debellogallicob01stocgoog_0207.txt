to the possession of land, but only to the mode of cultivation.
It is therefore, he maintains, as consistent with the idea of
private property aa it is with that of commuuism. And to
say that private property existed at this time among the
1 Germana he thinks is nearer to the truth than to spealr of
a system of communiam. Only, the kind of private property
then in force must be carefully distinguished from that known
to ns at the present day. It vas a system of family proprietor-
ship which was in vogue among the Gennans, with rights of
property not vested in the soil, but in the family itaelf‚ so that
η on changiug the area of cultivation each family was entitled
to the same amount of land that it had occupied previously.
, In support of this conclusion be cites the facts mentioned by
i Tacitus (G. ao, § 5) of heredity without testament and of males
’ only inheritiug. He finds the German family at this early
period one and indivisible in the two main ooncerns of life—
agn'culture and war. Monsieur Fustel de Conlanges‚ as we
have seen, has not attempted to reconcile these views with

ᾗ Caesar’s statements. But it might bc said that a proprietor-
, ship which vvas not confined to any given tract of soil might
well have appeared to Caesar to be no proprietorship at all,
and a system of annual¹ reassignment of land to be practically
indistinguishable from its possession by the state.
While Caesafs views on the land-question have been treated German

trith deferenoe in Franco, his statements about religion have⁰¹i²i⁰¹m

been brusquely rejected in Gennany. Jacob Grimm combats
with all the resources of his immense learning the opinion held
by some people that the earliest inhabitants of Germany ‘knew
nothing better than a gross werrici) of nature wrilour gods ’ἶ
On the contrary, he declares that ‘in the first century of our
era the religion of the Germana rested mainly upon gods' At
