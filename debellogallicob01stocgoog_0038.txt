6 CAESAR& sesac WAR

erumna senonens s cenoso sy nppan (a. ra, may „a
πρεσβείων) and reinforoed by Suetonius (J. C. η), who says
that the unsmupulous measnres adopted by Caesar made the

Senate at one time think of sending s commission to inquire
into tbe state os Gaul, and that some went so far asto vote
thet he should be surrendered to the enemy. But, apart from
authority, the faot is intrinsically probabis. Caesar states
unblushingly that he seized ambassadors; and knowing what
Cato was and what were his relations with Caesar, we might
surmise with confidence that this would be the line which Cato
would adopt.

There is yet one other slight indication of independent
evidence possessed by Plutarch He gives us a detail relative
to the siege oi Alesia which is not mentioned by Caesar, saying
that the Romans, who were guarding the countervallation, were
first apprised of the success of their countrymen against the
relieving force by hearing the lamentatione of the Gauls in
Alesia, when from their mountain-height they saw the spoils
ol their countrymen being carried into the Roman camp.
Plutarch also had acoess to the writiogs of C. Oppius, to whom
in Suetonius* time the authorship of the Alexandriae, African,
and Spanish Wars was ascribed by some (Suet J. C. 56). The
writings to which Plutarch alludes are distinct from those
that hate been y'ust mentioned, hut they hardly come under
the category oi independent evidence, as Plutarch himself
declares elsewhere (Pomp. ro) that the partiality of Oppius
for Caesar was such as to make bis statements require to
be received with mution when they related either to Caesar's
friends or foes. Oppius was one of those who, like Matius
and Balbus, had fallen under the personal magnetism os
Caesar, and were true to their friend in death as in life. One
oi his books was written to prove that Caranon was not
theson of Caesar, as Cleopatra claimed (Suet J. C. 52).

Sentonins Suetonius is a later writer than Plutarch. He speaks of
himself (Nero 57) as being a young man twenty years after
