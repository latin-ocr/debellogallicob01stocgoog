the centurion on duty was a cudgel ol vine-wood (‘vitis '), nor almeon
vas it always carried in vain. Every reader oi Tacitus vill ⁸
remember the centurion Lucilius, who, when he bad broken

calling out for a second, and so received from the men the

his merits were rewarded by T. Quinctius Flamininus with the
command ol the ‘decumus ordo hastatus,' the first rung in
the ladder of the centurionate. Alter the defeat of Philip at
Cynoscephalae (nc. 197) the army was transported to Italyand
disbanded. Ligustinus at once volunteered sor service in Spain
under Cato, tbe consul os 195. There was no keener judge of
merit than that great man, and he singled out our soldier lor
the command of the ‘primus hastatus prioris centuriae.' Ligus·
