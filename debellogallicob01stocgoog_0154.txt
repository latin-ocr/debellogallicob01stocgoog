122 cAESAR’s GALLIC WAR

That philosophioel historian had himself travelled in Atrion,
Spain, and Gaul, and be promises to correct some of the
erroneous notions os his predecessore with regard to the western
extremities ol the world, when be reaches a convenient point
in his treatiae (iii. 58, 59). Unlortunately the part olbis history

in which he redeemed this promise has not come down to us.
lt used indeed to be supposed that the British Isles had bad
α the honour ol being mentioned by Aristode. But though the
treatise De Mundo emanated lrom his school, it certainly did
not proceed from his pen, and critica are not now inclined to
place it much earlier than the Christian era. lt is there (iiis ra)
stated that in the Ocean, outside the Pillars ol Hercules and
beyond the country ol the Celts, there arc two very large

islanda called the British Isles ¹, Albion and Ierne.

'rhemum We may note in passing that on their first introduction to
¹⁸¹* the literary public os Europe England and Ireland were united
under a common appellation. Itis ‘the British lsles' os which
both Polybius and the Pen'patetic writer speak, as a collective
term lor England and Ireland together with the smaller islanda
that cluster round them. Althongh with Caesar the largest ol
these islanda has engrossed the common designation, yet Pliny
reminds us that Albion was the proper name os the island which
is now dirided into England and Sootland'‚ and it is under this
name, in its Greek form 'Alovtm ⁸, that the geographer Ptolemy
treats ol ic Beginning his map ol Europe hom the west, that
author deals first with lreland, which he calls Ἰουεριία, and then
with England and Scotland, but to each island alilre he gives

the name ol Βρσωιυ) νῆσος.
