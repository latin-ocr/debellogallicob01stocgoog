called ‘Martiales’ (Cic. Phil. iv. a, §5 5, 63 ad Fam. x. go);
later ou the practice besam habitual, as in the case of the
‘ Rapu’ and ‘Adiutrix' (Tac. H. ii. 43).

Of all Caesar's legions the Teuth vas the most famous, and TheTentu
this was the one in which he himself placed the greatest reliance. ww·
This was the one which he said should serve as iris body-guard
(‘praetoria cohors’) if uo one else followed him (i. 4ο §153
42, 5 5); this he himself calls ‘a picked legion’ (46,§ 3);
this was the one which he formd himself addressing when
‘he ran down, as chance offered, to encourage the soldiers,'

, before the battle ou the Sambre, and this was the one which
in that battle saved him frorn the Nervii (i. 21,§ 13 26,ss 4, 5)

ζ §ig-5). Tus was the oue which Caesar himself commanded
at Gergovia, and which there repressed the victorious onset
of Vercingetorix (vii. 47, § 13 51, i ι). It was this legion
which occupied the right vving at Pharsalia (C. iii. 89, i r), and
to it belonged the hero Crastinus, whom Caesar deemed to

(C. iii. 913 99). Lastly, this was the legion which, when it
mutinied, Caesar bent to his will hythe use of the single word
‘ Quirites’ (Suet. J. C. 70; Tac. A.'t 42).

Before we treat of the cohort proper let us say something tue
as to the ‘praetoria cohors' (στρατηγὶς τάξις, App. Civ. iv. 7), or {2}ssss
body-guard of the general, to which we bave seen Caesar
alluding. This was no nevv institution among the Romans.

To say nothing of its appearing in Livy (ii. 20, i 5) as early .
as the battle of Lake Regillus (nc. 498), its introduction is
ascribed by Festus (p. ²²3) to Scipio Africanus—he does not
say whether the elder or the younger-but his words seem to
have no reference to the body of 500 clients and friends which
Aemilianus brought with him from Rome to Numantia, and
which he called ‘amicorum cohors' (φίλων ἴλη, App. Hisp. 84).
According to Festus the pay of the praetorian cohort was half
