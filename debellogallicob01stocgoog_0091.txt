WARS WITH THE GAULS 59

the Triballi and the Thracians; another under Brennus and
Acichorius against Poeonia; a third under Bolgius or Belgius
(Justin. xxiv. 5) against the Macedoniam and Illyrians. The
adventures 11 this third division are better known than those
11 the other two. Ptolemy Ceraunus was then on the throne 11
Macedonia. Belgius offered to let him buy peace. He rejected
1111 offer, was defeated and slain, but the country was defended
by a general 111111 birth named sosthenes.

gives us the more moderate estimare ol 15o‚ooo loot and 15‚ooo
horse. Without going into numbers we may believe generally
that the Gauls on this occasion were 11 great 11111. They
ravaged all the lands 11 Macedonia, driving Sosthenes and bis
army to take refuge in the towns. Then they advanced south-
