tbe enemy were getting the mastery and their own men were
being hard pressed‚ it was theirs to stand their ground and die
rather than desert their posts' (Polyb. vi. 24, 59). Ewen amid
the decay oi the Roman arms the ideal ol the centurion was
still cherished ‘He must be ohosen,’ says Vegetius (ri. 14),
‘as being oi great strength and tall stature, able to discharge
spears and other missiles with dexterity and lotoe, skilled in
