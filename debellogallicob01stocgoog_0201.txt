laud. At the same time he says that in peace there was no
common magistracy, but that justice was administered in the
several districts and cantoris (ρῳ) by the local authorities
(vi. 23, i 5). We are therefore led to conclude that it was
these‘principes regionum atque pagorum'in their assembly (‘cum
una coierunt' ri. aa, § 2), who constituted the governing,r power
in the states described by Caesar: ior governing power there
must have been to effect the arrangement that one-hals oi
the maie population should stay at home every year to cultivate
the ground, and the other hali go out to war (iv. r, §§4, 5).

description therefore is only a partial one. It is as though one
were to take the constitution ol a single country, say that oi
Great Britain, as representative oi Europe generally. ‘The
kings' Tacitus tells us, ‘were chosen horn their nobility, but
leaders (duces) from their valour' (G. Μ 1). W hether these

But he seems purposely to contradict Caesar by denying that
the leaders in war had power of lile and death or even to flog
or imprison. These penalties could only be inflicted by the
priests, who were supposed to act under the sanction ol the
God oi Battles, whose symbols they bore into the field srom
the sacred grores where they were wont to hang (G. 7, ξ a).
