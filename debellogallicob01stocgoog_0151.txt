Pytheas of Massilia bas been called the Humboldt of anti-
quity. According to his own statement, as preserved to us in
a quotation from Polybius in Strabo (ii. p. 104), he visited all
Britain, so far as it was accessible, and alter having returned

voyages appear to bave been published in two works, one of

nearly as we can. Polybius complained of Eratosthenes for
putting saith in Pytheas, adding that Dicaearchus did not (Str.
ii. p. ros). Now Dicaearchus was a disciple of Aristode
(Cic. de Leg. iii. ξ 14), and his death is put somewhere about
no 285. It follows that Pytheas himself must have lived
before this, though how much before it is impossible to say.

This conclusion is confirmed by Pliny (N. H. xxxvii. ξ 35),
who says that Timaeus (352-256 nc.) accepted Pytheas’
opinion about amber.
