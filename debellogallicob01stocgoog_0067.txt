Bellovesus the smiling plains of Itely. Thitherhe set out with
the redundant manhood of sir tribes of Gaul-the Bituriges,
Arverni, Aedui, Ambarri, Carnutes, and Aulmci. But wbe'n
they cerne within sight of tbe Alps, of which history records no
previous crossing, unless we are tc regard Hercules as historical,
it is uo wonder ifthese men of the plains were inclined at first
to regnrd their sky-clad summits as inaccessible. Just then
they heard thet there was war between the Salyes and some
strangers who had descended on their coast from faroli
Phocaea, secking land whereon to found a city. Struck by the

Marseille. After this they found their way themselves over the
Alps, and descended iuto the plains cf N orthem Italy near Turin.
The Etruscans then occupied these regions, but the Gauls
defeated their army on the Ticinus, where Hannibal some four
centuries later defeated the Romans. Then learning that the
country in which they then were was called that of the insubres,
they hailed the omen-for this was the name of one of the

famous city, the Milan of today: to the Gauls it was Medic-

Santoni. Close cn the heels cf this first band of invaders cerne
another with the consent of Bellovesus. These were the Ceno·

where Brixia and Verona afterwards stood ¹. After this there
was an immigration cf Libui¹ and of Salluvii, the latter the
same as tbe Salyes already mentioned, who established them·

selves cn the banks of the Ticinus, near the Laevi, another tribe ·

of Ligurian origin. These were followed, but at what interval
