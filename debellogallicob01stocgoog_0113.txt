WARS WITH THE GAULS 81

from the mixed multitude of people, chiefly frorn the Pyrenees,
whom he quartered there.

ln the next year there was peace in Gaul itself, but M. Crassus, Victory os
who was then praetor, was engaged in slaughtering Gauls and ‘'cm''

Germans in Italy. lt was they who formed the strength of slliefesd.²e

the rabble hosts under the slave-leaders Granicus and Spartacus
(i 40, ξ 5; Liv. Epit. xcvii).
ln 66 and the following year C. Calpurnius Piso, the consul c. Calpur-

of 67, was proconsul in Gallia Narbonensis. He appears to have ffiffm ³¹¹

quelled some tumult there, as Cicero (ad Art. i. 13, ξ 2) calls
him ‘pacificator Allobrogum! We must suppose that Cisalpine
Gaul was also under his jurisdiction, as Cicer0, writing in 65,
when he was meditating his canvass for the consulship, tallrs
of taking an excursion to Piso as legatus between September
and the following january, owing to the importance of Gaul in
elections (ad Att. i. 1, ξ a: cp. Phil. ii. §7 ).
ln 64 Lucius Murena, who succeeded Cicero in the consul· Murmeand
ship, was pro-praetor in Gaul. One of the praises that Cicero ffi’GbJffl‘f
bestows on him is that by bis justice and diligence he enabled
his countrymen to recover bad debts in Gaul ¹. When he
returned to Rome in 63 to oanvass for the consulship, he left his
brother C. Murena in charge of the province as legatus (Cic.
llur.§ 893 Sall. Cat. 42). Gaul both within and without the
Alps was at this time in a disturbed state, and the discontent
of the people was being fomented hythe emissaries of Catiline,
sothai C. Murena had to throw a good many people into prison.
At Rome too an attempt was made to draw some envoys of the Periplayed
Alcmoges into the conspiracy. At first they were inclined to fflffi'

receive the proposal favourably, being willing to embarlr on ol the

desperate measures, if only they could free their country from 3¹¹⁰b¹⁰ff⁸⁸
