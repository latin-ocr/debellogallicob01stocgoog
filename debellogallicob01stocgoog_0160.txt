should say that the distance is 50 miles hythe shortest sea·
route from Gesoriacum¹ (iv. 5 roa).

What Tacitus (Agr. 10) bas to tell us aa to the situation oi
Britain is that it lies over against Germany to the east and
Spain to the west, that it is within sight of Gaul on the south,
but that its northern parts are beaten by a vast and open sea.

Dio Cassius (xxxin. 50, 5 a) informs us that Britain is distem
from the mainland ol Belgium, at the country oi the Morini,
450 stades (τ. 565 Roman miles) at the shortest, and that it
stretches along the rest of Gaui and almost all Spain. The
statement which has been already quoted from him as to tbe
breadth ol Britain is evidently the result ol later information
obtained in consequence ol the operatione of Sevems.

To the Greeks and Romans accustomed to the almost tideless
aeas ol the Mediterranean the ebb and flow oi the Ocean was
astanding source of marvel. Various theorica were started to
account lor this strange phenomenon. Some thought that it
was caused by the breathing ol the mighty being on whose
breast we dwell (Mela iii. 5 a). Cotta, vho supporta ithe
Academic position in Cicero's De Natura Deorum, is content
to set down the regular recurrence oi the tides in Spain and
Britain to nature ¹.

To Pytheas is asenbed by Plutarch the creditos having
detected the connexion between the tides and the moon. This
theory is vaguely referred to on hearsay in the Aristotelian
De Mundo (iv. 5 35). Mela (iii. 5 a) speaks ol the movcments
ol the tides and the moon as anotable case oi concomitant
variations. By Pliny (ii. 5 arr) the cause ol the tides is
confidently declared to be the sun and moon. The same
author (ii. 5 ²¹7) relates Pytheas to have recorded that above

¹ Gesoriacum, the modern Boulogne‚ is supposed to bave been built
just below the site ol Caeaar's Itium.
