GERMANY 167

disgusting to the Romans. Mela (iii. 5 28) says that ‘they
would eat their meat rats, either when it was fresh or after it
had been allowed to freeze in the hides ol the cattle or wild
beans, and had then been lreshened up by kneading it with the
hands or stamping it with the t'eet! Even now the eating os
raw llesh has not altogether disappeared from among the
Germans and Swedes But ilsomething was lacking in this
respect in the manners of the Germana, it was atoned ior by
their extreme hospitality, which Caesar (vi. 2 3, i 9) describes as
having the weight with them ol a religious obligation, and of
which Tacitus (G. 21) has drawn so charming a picture. Mela
(Μ 28) also mentions it. In this matter they had quite an
opposite reputation to that oi the ‘Britannos hospitibus leros!
Caesar (iv. r, ξ ιο; vi. ar, ξ 5) represents the clothing oi the clotbr'ng.
Germans as extremely primitive, consisting only ol skins and
the scanty upper garments known as ‘rhenones ².' Mela (Μή)
says that the men ‘wear saga or the lrark ol trees, no matter
how seuere the winter! The ‘sagum’ wasawoollen mantle, and
implies a knowledge ol spinning or wearing. Pliny speaks oi
the wearing ol flas as pretty general among the Gauls in his
day and already practised by ‘the enemy across the Rhine,'
whose women knew no finer dress than one ol linen’. He
adds that the work was carried on in holes dug out beneath the
ground, whereby we are reminded of what Tacitus (G. 16, ξ 4)
says ol the subterraneas storehouses lor grain among the
Germana. The same author (G. 17, § 3) corroboratos Pliny by
¹ Servius, commenting ou Verg. Geor. iii 383 ‘Et pecudum fulvis velatur
corpora saetis,’ explains the last word by ⁴ renonibus ' (the hlsolten omitted),

adding 'Nam ut Sallustius dicit iu historiim “Vestes de pellibus renones
vocantur.”’ Cp. the fragm of Sallust (assigned by Cortins to the aiath
book of the Histoties) which is quoted by isodorus ‘Germani intectum
renonibus corpus tegunt! Varro (L. 1. w. 5 167) says that ‘sagum' and
‘seno’ are Gallio words.
