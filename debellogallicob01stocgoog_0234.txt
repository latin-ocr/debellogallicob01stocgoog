M CAESAR'S Gamo WAR

was ignominiously put to ssight by 800 German horscmen
(iv. 12, 5 1)-—a striking sslustration oi Caesar's own remark that
the bare-backed German riders thought themselvesa match for
any number of cavalry who were effeminate enough to use
housings (iv. s, 5 5). nt the time oi the second invasion oi
Britain Caesar's cavalry is again down to acco (v. 5, 5 33
8, 55 r, a), though this is called ‘the cavalry oi the whole
of Gaul'

The Gallie cavalry, at least such part ol it as was permanendy
attached to Caesar's army, seems to bave been organized in
Roman sashion. Is was divided into ‘turmae’ (vi. 8, 5 5 ;
vii 45‚5 13 viii.18‚55 a, 3), sud bad Roman officere called
‘decuriones’ (i. 23, 5 a). It was commanded as a whole, first
by the young Publius Crassus (i. 52, 5 y), afterwards by
C. Volusenus Quadratus, with the title oi ‘ praefectus equitum'
(viii. 48,5 1; cp. C. iii. 60, 5 4). This title is also bestowed on
Quintus Atius Varus (viii. 28, 5 a), who may bave been
intermediate between the two.

The aid which Caesar derived from the Garris was not
confined to cavalry. He did not however count much on the
Gallio infantry, regarding mem as rather sor show than for
use ¹. At the time of the great revolt hc called upon the
Aedui for ro‚ooo loct-eddim, which he got, but not for long

(waitilivlebalmdy had occasion to allude to the mixed force of
cavalry and infantry which Cacsar inported from beyond the
Rhine (vii. 65, 5 45². Besides these foreigners he had in his

service Numidian and Cretan arebers and Balearic sliugers
