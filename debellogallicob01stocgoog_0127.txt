GAUL 95

From the physical we now turn to the mental and moral
characteristica os the Gaul. The portraiture oi memus anation
isdrawn with a surprising unanimity by the Greek and Roman
writers, so that we may accept itas in the main correct

That the Gaula were comageous is acknowledged on alfltchoemGagglgf

mnds, and by no one more handsomely than hy Caesar himsel
at least in the case of the Belgae (ii. 27). They were un·
doubtedly a people oi high spirit But their courage was ol an
impetuous and unreasoning kind, so that they were taken by the
Greek philosophers as the type ol rashneas ¹. From the first they
were a fighting people ¹, with aiore ol combat for its own sake.

Despite his unquestionable courage however, there was a boast- Boawlul-
illoesa about the Gaul which made him more lormidahle in Μ*
appearance than in reality. He was ‘full oi sound and krry,'
which, although they did not ‘signiiy nothing,' yet sometimes
allowed the performance to fall short oi the promise. It was his
habit to try to frighten his enemy before the iray hy dancing

and elashing his arms3 like the Homeric heroes too, he would
deliver lnrangues tending ‘to malign hia opponente and to
glorify himself ¹! The Roman learnt to diseount the terrors of

hia appearance, his irowning iace, hia deep, rough voice, his
threamoing attitudea, and Livy compressas intoa single pregnant
sentem the experience oi his countrymen when he speaks oi

the Gauls aa ‘nata in vanos tumultus gens' (Liv. v. 37, § 8).

The irascibility⁴ and quarrelsomeness os the Gauls was carried {gistai-
