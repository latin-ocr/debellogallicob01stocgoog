4 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

us by attributing it to another writer. Lastly‚ ior some at
least oi the events narrated, Xenophon is not the sole original η
authority, for an account was given oi the battle oi Cunaxa ἵ
and oi many incidents relatiug to Clearchus by Ctesias the
Greek physician oi Artaxerxes (Xen. Anah. i. 8,§ 26: Plut. ἵ
Artor.11).
Another partial parallel that might be adduced is the account
by Josephus of the Jewish war, and especially oi the siege
ol Jotapata, the defence oi which he conducted in person3
but that did not pass unchallenged in his own time, as he '
shows by his acrimonious references to the rival historiam
Justus oi Tiberias.
This unique advantage possessed by Caesar has been used
by him with an admirable discretiori. It is difficolt, in any ¹
case, to read a story without sympathizing with the hero. 1
But in this particular case the story is told with such an air
ol truthluhress, and with such a winning gmce and modesty,
that our admiration lor Caesar is iar more enhanced Ἴ
than if he had exhausted all the resources ol rhetoric, as
Cicero would have done in his place, in trumpeting his own
prarses.
Pauctty οἱ But what was Caesar’s advantage is our disability in secking
{ffifflfss to iorm a critical estimate oi the truth oi his narrative. We
have hardly any means ol getting behind his statements or Ξ
os bringing independent evidence to bear upon them. The
most detailed account that we have ol the Gallio War, other 3
than Caesar's own, is contained in certain chapters oi Dio s
cassus, books xxxvia-21¹. sut tuen, when arn nio Cassius Ῑ
live? He wrote in the reign oi Severus (xxxix. 50 ad fin),
¹ xxxviii. 31-50, the campaign against the Helvetians and Ariovistus3 ³

xxxia. 1-5· the campaign against the Belgae; 40-53, the campaigns against J
the Veneti and the Aquitaniana, the passage oi the Rhine‚ and the first
invasion oi Britain, xl. 1-11. the second invasion oi Britain, the destruction ἕ
oi Cotta and Sabinus, the deience oi his camp by Quintus Cicero, and the
success oi Labienus against the Treviri; :tr—43, the parauit oi Ambiorix Ῑ
and the suppression oi the great revolt in Gaul. ¹
