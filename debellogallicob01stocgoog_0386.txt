the transport of the legions, besides which there were a few ships
of war. Eighteen more merchant-vessels were lying wind-bound
in a harbour eight miles further up the coast The cavalry were
ordered to embarlr on these. Meanwhile Caesar and the legions
set sail at midnight with a fair wind About nine or ten 0’clock
next morning he was lying under the beetling cliffs of Britain, which

Caesar knew very well that tlte peace which he had made with
the Britons would not prevent their trying to make an example of
