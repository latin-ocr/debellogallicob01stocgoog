18 CAESAR'S GALLIC WAR

himself with works ol art and objecta ol beauty generally, and
spared no expense in procuring them
Despite his semblance of effeminacy, ‘the loosely·girt lad,' as

Sulla called him, had a physical energy equal to his mental.
His body seemed to be made oi iron and to be incapable ol
feeling fatigue. His skill in arms was remarkable. He could
ride a horse with his hands behind bis back, and could swirn
rivers when they carne in his way. He would travel by post as
much as a hundred miles a day, taking bis sleep in the vehicle.
He reached the thne from Rome in aweek, and Further Spain
lrorn Rome in twenty-tour days. It was on one olbis hurried
joumeys across the Alps, alter holding the assises in Cisalpine
Gaul, that his treatise on grammar was composed (Suet J. C.
56, 7: Plut. Caes. 17). His health was not naturally good,as he
was liable to epilepsy‚ a disease from which he suffered first at
Corduba, and by which be was twice interrupted in the trans-
action ol business. But this morbid tendency was fought down
by his tremendous physical activity, which left him no time to
be ill. It was only alter his triumph was accomplished that
his health gave way, when he suffered from sainting fits and
nightmare².

moralist He was lavisb and anconscientioua Overwbelmed
with debt himself, he had halt his countrymen in debt to him.
He never scrupled to buy support, whether by extravagant
outlay or by direct bribery. The wonder is where all the money
came lrom that he squandered His Cisalpine province, when
he was there, was a very cave of Adollam, where every social
outeast and banlrrupt debtor was sure to find a welcorne and
assistance. While he used his countrymen to conquer tbe
Gauls, be was at the same time using the spoils of the Gauls,
as Plutarch epigrammatically puts it, to conqner his countrymen.
